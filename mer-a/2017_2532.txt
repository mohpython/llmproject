Little Hot Springs Valley (LHSV) in particular hosts a wide range of hydrothermal conditions and associated deposits, including acid-sulfate fumaroles, mud pots, and hot springs, near-neutral, travertine-depositing hot springs, and near-neutral gypsum-depositing hot springs (Fig. 1) [2]. These varied sources originate as part of the same hydrothermal system in some cases within meters of  each other, revealing a complex system.  Figure 1: Field photos at LHSV. A: acid-sulfate fumarole, with white sulfate precipitates (alunogen, halotrichite). B. Organic filaments and mineral precipitates in a near-neutral hot spring. C. Hot spring related travertine deposit. D. acid-sulfate mud pot (kaolinite dominated).  Purported hydrothermal features near Home Plate, explored by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit at Gusev Crater, have also been suggested to represent a range of hydrothermal enviornments in a small area, including acid-sulfate fluids or fumaroles [3,4] and near-neutral sinter-depositing hot springs [5,6]. Comparison to similar deposits on Earth can help interpret these features, and assess whether such diverse deposits require multiple, distinct alteration events or whether they could be formed by one laterally varying hydrothermal system.  Methods: We visited LHSV in 2014 and collected water, rock, altered sediment/mud, and mineral precipitate samples from different hydrothermal contexts (see examples in Figures 1 and 2). We tested thermal waters for temperature (T) and pH, and cooled water samples to below 50°C for field analysis using a Hydrolab sonde  for T, pH, oxidation/reduction potential (ORP), Specific Conductivity (SpCond), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and salinity (sal). Lab analyses included X-ray Diffraction (XRD) for mineralogy and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) for geochemistry (methods of [7]).         XRD and XRF results: Sulfate minerals were abundant and varied in LHSV altered sediments and precipitates, reflecting varied conditions. Redox differences are shown in the presence of sulfates vs. sulfides (Figures 2 and 3). XRD results reported in Table 1.  Figure 2: Samples collected near fumarole, showing smallscale mineralogy variations. The deepest sample (L-LV-1423) is mostly smectite and pyrite, while the shallower samples have more quartz and sulfate minerals (alunite and alunogen). XRD results from these three samples are shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3: XRD patterns for L-LV-14-21, 22, and 23 (Figure 2). Q = quartz, S = smectite, Al = alunogen, A = alunite, and P = pyrite. Pyrite is present in the deepest sample (L-LV-1423), and sulfates are present in the shallower samples (samples 21 and 22), where quartz is also more abundant.

The "substrate" of LHSV is complex, including both fresh andesite to dacite and blocks altered by previous episodes of hydrothermal alteration [8]. The ubiquity of quartz in the altered samples reflects both a silica-rich substrate and residual enrichment of silica during alteration. Enrichment reached 93% SiO2 in one sample (L-LV-14-5), and enriched TiO2 in the same sample (3.13%, compared to 0.74% in unaltered andesitic substrate) suggests residual enrichment, a likely result of acid-sulfate alteration. Samples near the headwaters of LHSV included travertine-precipitating hot springs (Hydrolab results in Table 2); precipitates consisted almost entirely of calcite. In downstream areas, gypsum was precipitated near near-neutral hot springs, while other sulfates were more common near acidic hot springs and fumaroles.

Travertine springs dominate the headwaters, while both near-neutral (gypsum-associated) and acidic (other sulfate-associated) hot springs occur within meters of each other in the lower part of the valley. The acidic springs are also more saline and have higher TDS than the neutral springs. While all water samples analyzed were at least slightly reducing (ORP <0), the travertine precipitating hot springs were the most extreme.  Discussion:  The assemblage of precipitated minerals can be attributed at least in part to the characteristics of the associated hydrothermal fluids, with clear asociations between pH, salinity, and minerals observed. Gypsum and calcite precipitate from more neutral fluids, while Al-, Fe-, Mg-, and Na-sulfates occur near acidic hot springs and fumaroles. Darker, pyrite-bearing "mud" at depth points toward a shallow oxidation front, with more reducing conditions below and more oxidizing conditions above. Geochemical trends were less clear, since it is difficult to separate the different generations of hydrothermal alteration using bulk composition alone, but do show some examples of Si- and Tirich residual deposits formed by acid-sulfate leaching.  Mars comparison: The presence of near-neutral and acid-sulfate hydrothermal conditions in close proximity could be comparable to what is inferred for hydrothermally altered deposits near Home Plate, though the absence of opaline silica sinter associated with the neutral fluids at LHSV makes this analog less suitable than others at Lassen (e.g. Growler hot spring). The hydrothermal conditions that favor precipitation of specific sulfate mineral assemblages at LHSV could, however, be used to help decipher the conditions needed to form Martian sulfate deposits.
