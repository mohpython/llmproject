Introduction:  In addition to igneous rocks, numerous alteration  products  have  been  identified  on Mars  including clay minerals, chlorite, mica, prehnite, zeolites, serpentine,  carbonate,  sulphates,  hydrated  silica,  and oxides [1], indicative of multiple and diverse aqueous activity and  environments ranging from Martian  surface conditions to deeper crustal levels. While a substantial part of the observed alteration products can be associated with surface weathering processes, evaporation,  diagenesis,  and  impact-generated  hydrothermal systems as predicted by thermochemical models [2-7], certain minerals such as prehnite require higher temperatures (200-400 °C) and are therefore indicative of low-grade metamorphic or  hydrothermal alteration of mafic rocks at depth prior to being exposed by cratering [8,9]. Since metamorphic rocks seem to be more widespread on Mars than initially predicted and are expected from thermochemical constraints to form larger parts of the lower crust, understanding their formation conditions and distribution provides useful information about  the  composition  and  evolution  of  the  Martian crust. A number of thermochemical studies have predicted  the  formation  of  alteration  minerals  using basaltic and ultramafic protoliths reacting with hydrothermal fluids [2-7], but focused on temperatures below 300 °C, relatively high water to rock ratios, and pressures equating to less than 10 km in Martian crustal depth beneath the surface. Furthermore, generic phase diagrams for terrestrial mafic and ultramafic rocks have been used for the recognition of low-grade metamorphic  assemblages  [1,10],  or  the  plotting  of  Martian rock compositions [9]. Phase diagrams established for terrestrial rocks, however, may not always adequately represent  Martian  basalts  due  to  their  compositional differences  influencing  mineral  stability  and  consequently the metamorphic facies. The aim of this study is to provide compositionally and pressure-temperature dependent phase assemblages for low-grade metamorphic Martian crustal rocks using a variety of protolith compositions  and  comparing  them  to  terrestrial analogs. Method:  All phase diagrams have been calculated with the Gibbs free energy minimization software Perple_X 6.7.5 [11] using an internally consistent thermodynamic data set [12, and 2002 update]. For simplicity, our calculations assume iron to be divalent and fluid as pure H2O resulting in the system TiO2-Na2O-CaO-K2OFeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O  (TiNCKFMASH)  for  the P-T range of 0.001-0.5 GPa and 150-450 °C.

Dotted area represents prehnite, and wavy area pumpellyite stability fields. A possible Martian geotherm of 13 °C/km is shown by the red line We used the following solid solutions: clinopyroxene and olivine [12]; chlorite, ilmenite, and white mica [13];  actinolite,  pumpellyite,  and stilpnomelane  [14]; 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083) biotite  [15]; antigorite [16]. Due to plagioclase being nearly pure albite at low P-T conditions, no solid-solution model was specified. We calculated sections of a phase diagram for  a  specified composition, so-called pseudosections,  using  water-saturated  compositions (Table 1) of an average MORB [17], a measurement of Bounce rock (interior) by Opportunity [18], representative for meteorite basalts, and Portage soil obtained in Gale Crater by Curiosity [19]. The depth scale was calculated  with the  formula  P  =  ρgh  using an  average crustal density of 2960 kg/m3 and g of 3.727 m/s2 [20]. A geotherm of 13 °C/km [21] has been added. Table 1: Rock compositions used for calculation of pseudosections MORB [17] Bounce Rock [18] Portage [19] wt.% SiO2 50.42 51.6 43.88 TiO2 1.53 0.74 1.19 Al2O3 15.13 10.5 9.43 FeO 9.81 14.4 19.19 MgO 7.76 6.8 8.69 CaO 11.35 12.1 7.28 Na2O 2.83 1.7 2.72 K2O 0.14 0.1 0.49 Results:  MORB and Bounce Rock are compositionally  similar  and  therefore  show the  typical  very low-grade to low-grade metamorphic phases including zeolites, pumpellyite, prehnite, chlorite and actinolite. Due to the lower Al2O3  content of Bounce Rock, however, the stability fields of both pumpellyite and zeolites  are  reduced  at  the  expense  of  prehnite  and clinopyroxene. The Portage soil composition has significantly lower silica and much higher FeO than both MORB and Bounce Rock. As a result, neither prehnite nor pumpellyite are stable while minerals typical for ultramafic metamorphic rocks such as antigorite (serpentine), olivine and ilmenite are abundant phases. While MORB and Bounce Rock show a variety of zeolites such as laumontite, stilbite and wairakite, the predominant zeolite mineral in the less silica-rich portage soil is analcime. Discussion: The prehnite-pumpellyite stability field is extremely small or absent for basaltic compositions, possibly due to problems with the available thermodynamic data. However, the pumpellyite stability field is not reached with a 13 °C geotherm. Calculating with ferrous iron is a reasonable approach for basalts, but portage soil is expected to contain larger amounts of ferric  iron,  which  has  to  be  addressed  in  future  research. If the fluid were not pure H2O but a brine, additional phases such as carbonates, sulfates and possibly phosphates are expected. Our phase diagrams are in accordance  with  the  detected  prehnite-chlorite  assemblages for basaltic rocks as well as serpentine and analcime for silica-poor compositions [8]. The detection of zeolites by remote sensing, however, seems to be hindered by the presence of other metamorphic minerals. Conclusions  and  outlook: Compositional  differences of Martian mafic and ultramafic rocks strongly influence  the  mineral  stability  fields  and  low-grade metamorphic facies. While some compositions such as Bounce Rock, resemble terrestrial  basalts in mineralogy,  phase  stability fields  are  very sensitive  to  even small compositional protolith variations. Although the presented pseudosections already emphasize the importance  of  pressure-temperature  and  compositional  dependent phase diagrams for a better understanding of Martian  subsurface  rocks,  additional  aspects  such  as more  protolith  compositions,  varying  water  content, variations in fluid compositions as  well  as  oxidation states remain to be explored.
