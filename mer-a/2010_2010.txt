Introduction:  Fe sulfates were found by two Mars Exploration Rovers in surface explorations and by CRISM on MRO through orbital remote sensing. Among them, Jarosite ((K,Na,H3O)Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6) was identified in Meridiani outcrop by Mössbauer spectroscopy (MB) [1]. MB spectral analysis also indicated the presence of a non-specific ferric sulfate within the light-toned salty soils exposed by the Spirit rover at several sites in Gusev Crater [2, 3, 4, 12]. A Pancam spectral deconvolution suggested the existence of ferricopiapite (Fe2/33+Fe43+(SO4)6(OH)2.20H2O), hydronium jarosite ((H3O)Fe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6), fibroferrite (Fe3+(SO4)(OH).5H2O), rhomboclase (HFe3+(SO4)2.4 (H2O), and paracoquimbite (Fe3+2(SO4)3.9H2O) in these Gusev salty soils [5]. A combined study of Pancam and MiniTES data with laboratory experiments also suggested that ferricopiapite is the major constituent in Paso Robles salty soils [6]. Using CRISM data, hydrated Fe sulfates were found on the floor of Valles Marineris canyon system and on the plains that surround it [7]. Szomolnokite (FeSO4.H2O) was identified at Juventae Chasm [8]. A ferric sulfate hydroxide (Fe(SO4)OH) was suggested at Aram Chaos by CRISM data [9]. The first phase transition of ferric sulfates (potentially, the dehydration of ferricopiapite [10,11]) on Mars was observed by Spirit at Gusev, demonstrated by a temporal VIS-NIR (from Pancam 13F observation) spectral changes of Tyrone yellowish soils after their 175 sols exposure to the Martian surface atmospheric conditions [12].  The finding of Fe sulfates on Mars has been driving many laboratory experimental studies on their fundamental properties [10,11,13,14].  Our study of ferric sulfates was conducted in three steps. First, we synthesized eight common ferric sulfates and obtained characteristic Raman spectra from them [13]. Five of these synthesized ferric sulfates were used for a set of stability field and transition pathway studies [10,11,15], where the Raman spectra obtained previously were used for non-invasive phase identification of intermediate reaction products. The preliminary results from the second step of experiments gave us clues to constrain the potential locations of phase boundaries among hydrated ferric sulfates in the relative humiditytemperature (RH-T) space, from which we started the phase boundary study as the third step.  We choose to study the phase boundary between kornelite (Fe2(SO4)3·7H2O; 7w) and pentahydrated ferric sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3.5H2O; 5w) as the first pair, because their phase transition does not involve acidity and redox changes. Experimental method:  We used the humidity buffer technology to find the exact locations of two points at 7w-5w phase boundary in RH-T space.  Saturated KI and NaBr solutions were selected to provide welldefined relative humidities at various temperatures [16]. The experimental procedures were described by Chou et al. [17]. The starting materials were mixtures of synthesized 7w and 5w [13]. Their identities were confirmed by XRD analysis. Their homogeneities were confirmed by over-20-points with Raman microbeam analysis. The typical amount of mixed sample used for each experiment was about 200-400 milligrams, which was loaded into a glass sample vial of 8 mm in diameter and 30 mm tall. The uncapped sample vial was partly immersed into a humidity buffer solution in a larger glass vial (15 mm diameter and 45mm tall). The RH buffer vial was tightly sealed and totally immersed in a water bath whose temperature was controlled to an accuracy of 0.1ºC.   In the experiments for Mg-sulfate phase boundary studies [18], the mass change was used to find the exact T-RH points on the phase boundary. However, the observed total mass change should have two causes: the phase transition between hydrated sulfates, and the change of adsorbed water on the mineral grain surfaces due to the change of T and RH.  For ferric sulfates, the later change was a greater proportion of the total observed mass change because the relative mass change for ferric sulfates when one H2O molecule being gained is much less than that for Mg-sulfate (only ~ 4 wt% instead of  ~ 20 wt %). Also, due to the lack of knowledge on the phase transition pathways of ferric sulfates in general, there is a possibility that other ferric sulfates may occur during the designed experiments. Therefore, we modified the experimental procedure by (1) putting the starting samples (7w and 5w) in the same RH buffer solutions (KI or NaBr) for more than 72 hours and trying to reach the saturation of adsorbed water at the similar temperatures within each sample's stability field before the start of phase boundary experiments, and (2) performing multiple Raman microbeam analyses for each experiment on the final reaction product, in order to monitor the occurrence of unexpected ferric sulfates.   Results and discussion: For the kornelite - pentahydrated ferric sulfate reaction:  Fe2(SO4)3.7H2O(s)= Fe2(SO4)3.5H2O(s)+ 2H2O(g) (1) (where s and g refer to solid and gas phases, respectively),    ΔGr0 = -RT (%RH)/100 where ΔGr tion; K is (8.31451 J equilibrium pure H2O.
