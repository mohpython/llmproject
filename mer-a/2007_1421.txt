 OVERVIEW OF RECENT ATHENA MICROSCOPIC IMAGER RESULTS. K. E. Herkenhoff1 (kherkenhoff@usgs.gov), S. Squyres2, R. Arvidson3, and the Athena Science Team, 1U. S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, AZ 86001; 2Cornell Univ.; 3Washington Univ. Introduction: The Athena science payload [1] on the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) includes the Microscopic Imager (MI). The MI is a fixed-focus camera mounted on the instrument arm. The MI acquires images at a scale of 31 microns/pixel over a broad spectral range (400 - 700 nm). The MI acquires images using only solar or skylight illumination of the target surface. The MI science objectives, instrument design and calibration, operation, and data processing were described by Herkenhoff et al. [2]. Initial results of the MI experiment on both MER rovers ("Spirit" and "Opportunity") have been published previously [3,4,5]. Highlights of these and more recent results are described below. Spirit (MER-A) results: As examined by the MI, soil materials at Gusev show texture down to the limit of resolution (~100 microns). Soil surfaces are typically rough at submillimeter scales but are molded to much smoother surfaces under compression by the Mössbauer (MB) contact plate and/or a rover wheel, suggesting the presence of a substantial fraction of particles too small to be resolved. It is unclear whether remolding was accomplished by compression of void space and reorganization of existing particles versus by destruction of weak particles to even smaller sizes. Original soil texture was obliterated by the ~1 N force applied by the MB contact plate. If this was due to crushing of particles, the original particles must have been very weak. These observations are consistent with electrostatic cohesion or minor cementation of dust grains. Some of the MI images of soil or dusty rocks show linear textures that may have been formed by recent winds. Bedforms at Gusev have coarser particles at their crests and finer grains in the troughs, like aeolian ripples on Earth [6]. Particle-size frequencies of sampled ripple surfaces typically are bimodal, with one mode centered between 1 and 2 mm (coarse sand to very fine granules) and the other below 210 μm (fine to very fine sand). MI observations of rocks on the Gusev plains that were abraded by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) reveal evidence for thin coatings on the rocks, which may be products of alteration by water. The images show mineral grains, probably phenocrysts, beneath the coatings. These observations are consistent with the plains rocks being weakly-altered basalts, as indicated by other Spirit observations [7]. MI images of basaltic rocks in the Columbia Hills do not show evidence for phenocrysts, but were taken after it was no longer possible to grind into the rocks with the RAT and expose their unweathered interiors [8]. Many rocks in the Columbia Hills have different textures than the rocks on the plains. The rock "Pot o' Gold" appears to contain nodules in a less-resistant matrix, but the composition of the nodules cannot be determined from MI observations. This rock has probably been eroded by a combination of chemical weathering and aeolian abrasion. Higher in the Columbia Hills, MI observations of RAT holes show a variety of textures, with clasts of sizes ranging down to the MI resolution limit. These images, along with observations by the other Athena instruments, suggest that these rocks are altered volcaniclastics or impact ejecta. MI images of the lower unit of "Home Plate" show granules typically 0.5-3 mm in size, while images of the upper unit show well-rounded and sorted grains 200-400 microns in diameter (Fig. 1). These and other Spirit observations suggest that Home Plate was formed by a volcanic explosion, followed by aeolian reworking of the volcaniclastic debris to form the upper unit [9]. More recently, the MI has been used to image insitu spectroscopy targets and to search for changes in the soil at Spirit's winter haven on "Low Ridge." These and other recent MI observations will be presented and discussed at the conference. Figure 1. MI image 2M194100679 of portion of upper unit of Home Plate after brushing by Rock Abrasion Tool. Grains are very well rounded and sorted. Image is 3 cm across, taken when the target was in shadow.  Opportunity (MER-B) results: MI observations of soil-like materials within Eagle crater and on the surrounding plains have been used to assess cohesion and cementation of very fine-grained (<125 �m) material, based upon soil morphology after disturbances caused by the rover wheels and by the MB contact plate. Granules on the surface typically are pressed into the underlying very fine sand by MB contact; cohesion between grains is indicated where this results in very short, near-vertical walls in the surrounding soil. Some MI observations of soils disturbed by the MB contact plate show apparent fractures, suggesting that cementation of surface particles has formed a crust. The thickness of this crust is estimated to be at least 1 mm (the penetration depth of the MB contact plate) based upon images taken after the surface was disrupted. Plausibly, and consistent with APXS spectra of soil-like deposits at the Meridiani site, the cementation is caused by precipitation of various salts (e.g., Cl- and SO4bearing) that bridge soil particles. Salts in the dust (unresolved by the MI) may dissolve and migrate into voids between soil particles in thin films of water adsorbed onto soil particles. Thin liquid films may occur in soils when the spin axis obliquity and atmospheric relative humidity are high enough to cause precipitation or condensation of water. During warming events, salts may precipitate on soil particles as thin liquid films evaporate, weakly cementing the upper soil surface. In the investigation of sedimentary rocks exposed at Meridiani Planum, the MI has provided key data that help to integrate observations made by Pancam with chemical analyses made by APXS, MB, and Mini-TES [9]. MI images indicate that outcrop rocks have four principal components: (i) moderately rounded medium to coarse (0.2 to 1 mm) sand grains (probably reworked heterogeneous evaporites— mixtures of sulfates and very fine-grained siliciclastic material) that form mm-scale laminations; (ii) fine grained and coarser crystalline textures of subsequently precipitated cements and areas of recrystallization; (iii) centimeter-size vugs that record the early diagenetic growth and subsequent dissolution of crystals similar to sulfate crystals in terrestrial evaporites, and (iv) mostly 3-5 mm spherules distributed throughout the outcrops. MI images document spatial relationships among these constituents, recording a complex history of deposition and diagenesis [10]. In places, finegrained evaporite muds appear to have been ripped up, transported and redeposited. Sandy laminae have been cemented, probably by sulfate minerals, during earliest diagenesis. The large vugs cut across bedding, indicating that the minerals that once filled them also formed diagenetically within the sediments. Where present, the vugs are found to continue into the rock for at least as deep as the Rock Abrasion Tool was able to grind (~ 5 mm) and commonly are seen to increase in size with increasing abrasion depth. Accordingly, they are interpreted to represent an intrinsic feature of the outcrops. Vugs exhibit prismatic to discoidal geometry, characteristically with maximum width (1-2 mm) near their midpoints and tapering toward their ends. This morphology is consistent with precipitation of certain evaporite minerals within the rock matrix, either displacing or replacing the matrix grains during growth. Vug geometry is most consistent with a monoclinic precursor mineral. Subsequently, these minerals were either dissolved by percolating fluid or abraded by wind activity to produce the vugs. MI images and mosaics provide evidence for the presence of small-scale cross bedding with festoon geometry at Meridiani Planum. An MI mosaic of part of the outcrop dubbed "Overgaard" shows festoon cross-lamination similar to that observed in Eagle crater (Fig. 2). The MI images confirm two key features that lead to the interpretation of water having flowed at times across the surface at the landing site: centimeter-scale cross-stratification and festoon geometry of cross-lamination. Stereo images of the Overgaard outcrop have been used to generate a digital elevation model of the surface, which shows that the features interpreted as festoons are not correlated with topographic undulations [11]. These and other recent MI images will be shown at the conference. Figure 2. Mosaic of 18 MI images of outcrop "Overgaard", acquired on Sols 721 and 723 with illumination from top.
