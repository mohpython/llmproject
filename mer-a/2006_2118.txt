Introduction: For over two years of surface operations of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, topographic maps, rover traverse maps, and updated rover locations of Spirit and Opportunity have supported tactical and strategic mission operations. The initial results of topographic mapping and rover localization are published in [1, 2, 4-7] and presented in the 36th LPSC [3]. Here we present the recent topographic products and the latest localization results. Rover Localization: As of January 6, 2006 (Spirit's Sol 715, Opportunity's Sol 695), Spirit has traveled 5.42 km and Opportunity 6.30 km (actual distances traveled instead of odometry measures).  We performed bundle adjustment (BA)-based rover localization for the Spirit rover at the Gusev Crater site sol by sol using full or partial Navcam/Pancam panoramic images, and, occasionally, forward- and backward-looking Navcam/Pancam middle point survey images. Overall, after BA, 2D accuracy is sub-pixel to 1.5 pixels and 3D accuracy is at a centimeter to submeter level based on consistency check of the BA results. At the end of the traverse up to Sol 670, the accumulated difference between the traverse from telemetry and the bundle-adjusted traverse is 51.8 m, or 1.1 percent of the distance traveled from the landing point, with a maximum of 2.7 percent (20.6 m over 775.7 m) on Sol 106. Starting from Sol 154, we performed a local comparison of rover traverses in the Husband Hill area where Spirit experienced significant wheel slippage climbing the hill. As of sol 670, the locally accumulated difference between the telemetryderived traverse and the bundle-adjusted traverse was 67.9 m, or 3.7 percent of the traveled distance of 1.85 km, with a maximum of 10.5 percent (56.6 m over 540.6 m) on Sol 337. This demonstrates that the BA was able to correct significant localization errors. For Opportunity rover at the Meridiani Planum site, BA was conducted within Eagle Crater (up to Sol 62) and was able to correct localization error as large as 21 percent caused by wheel slippage [1, 3]. After leaving Eagle Crater, BA-based rover localization was impossible due to insufficient localization image data and lack of distinct features along most parts of the traverse. Wherever we observed large features such as Eagle, Frame, Endurance, Argo, Jason, Naturaliste and Vostok craters, we generated orthophotos of these features and compared them with the MOC NA (Mars Orbiter Camera Narrow Angle) base map to adjust the rover traverse. Though not optimal, this adjustment strategy enabled us to provide the Opportunity traverse in a timely manner. On March 30, 2004 (Spirit's Sol 85) and August 18, 2004 (Spirit's Sol 223), MSSS acquired two MOC NA images showing Spirit's track on the MOC images [8]. We used the 1 m-resolution mosaic of these two images (release No. MOC2-960) to compare the track with the bundle-adjusted rover traverse. The shape and scale of the bundle-adjusted traverse and the track on the MOC NA mosaic match well. However, there is a relative rotation difference of 1.3 degrees. A large part of this may be because the MOC image mosaic was "uncontrolled", i.e., the imaging geometry is computed solely from the pointing information of the orbital telemetry without any further adjustment. On November 2, 2005 (Spirit's Sol 652), MSSS acquired another MOC NA image centered at the Husband Hill summit. Although the rover track is not visible, the rover itself was identified from the image [8]. We identified that position on our georeferenced base map. In comparing this MOC imaged rover location with the bundle-adjusted rover position of Sol 652, a difference was found of about 20 m, or 0.4 percent of the overall traverse of 4559 m. The location difference in this comparison may be largely caused by the accumulated map georeferencing errors (a few strips cross the landing site). It is important to note that the 20 m difference between the bundle-adjusted rover location and the rover location on the MOC imagery does not mean that the absolute accuracy of the rover localization is 20 m. This difference may consist of the georeferencing error of the MOC base map and the residuals of the BA. Overall, bundle-adjusted rover locations match the MOC imaged rover positions well. Rover location information from both ground and orbital imagery is complementary. Ground image-based rover localization is desirable and critical for sol by sol operations, while  mailto:li.2@osu.edu rover positions from orbital images provide a way to verify the BA results. Topographic Mapping: By Sol 715 for Spirit and Sol 695 for Opportunity, we generated timely topographic products including 110 orthophotos and DTMs, and six 3D crater models, as well as periodical traverse maps and vertical profiles.  At the Opportunity site, stereo Pancam images from the west and southeast rims of Endurance crater along with the wide-baseline Pancam images taken within the crater were used to produce a 0.3 mresolution DTM after an integrated bundle adjustment. Fig. 1 is a 3D view of the crater, which has a diameter of about 156 m and a depth of about 20 m. At the Spirit site, an integrated DTM was generated and expanded using multiple Navcam and Pancam (including wide-baseline) panoramas taken from Sol 576 to Sol 696 at the Husband Hill summit and within the south inner basin. Fig. 2 shows DTM and contours (central part, 690Ã—640 m) of this area on top of a MOC NA base map and contours derived from a USGS DTM. Fig. 3 shows a corresponding slope map that can be used to plan rover traverse areas in the up coming local Martian winter for the maximized solar panel orientation. Applications: The topographic maps and rover localization data have been used in strategic planning and tactical operations. They have also been used to support various scientific investigations specially requested by scientists. For example, the 3D model and derived vertical profiles of Endurance Crater were intensively used in geological analysis of the crater. Also, the slope map of the south inner basin has been very helpful for picking north-facing slopes where the rover can capture more solar energy during the winter season.
