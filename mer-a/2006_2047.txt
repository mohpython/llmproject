Introduction:  We have been investigating ripples and dunes of diverse scales throughout the western United States [1-4], for comparison with a wealth of aeolian features revealed in recent data from Mars.  Here we focus on recent measurements of granule ripples at Great Sand Dunes National Park (GSDNP) in southern Colorado, as well as the impressive range of scales over which aeolian ripples are now documented on Mars.  These data have important implications for modes of particulate transport on Mars. Granule Ripples:  Bagnold [5] and others [6,7] describe the similarities and differences between wind-generated ripples in fine sand and larger features that typically are coated with a layer of coarse sand to granules.  We have visited many of the classic granule ripple sites in the southwestern U.S. described by Sharp [7], collecting profiles across the features of various wavelength scales [1, 2, 4].  Large granule ripples are common at GSDNP, where 1-2 mm granules derived from nearby Medano Creek are transported by the wind to collect along the southwestern margin of the main dune mass (Fig. 1).

We have previously made several attempts to document the granule ripple movement at GSDNP, but until recently we were unable to relocate the plants used for markers of the survey lines.  One line surveyed in 2004 was finally recovered in 2005; we are confident that we have reoccupied the 04 survey end points to within ~20 cm horizontally.  The surveys are done using a laser beam as the local referent; transects are later generated with the local slope removed (Fig. 2).   Since the dominant storm Figure 2.  Surveyed topographic transects collected one year apart.  Westerly winds moved ripples (A, B) to the east (A', B'), and lowered ripple amplitudes. winds at GSDNP are from the west-southwest [8], we conclude that the landforms have migrated toward the east (A to A', B to B' in Fig. 2). While we have no documentation indicating that the landforms have not moved more than one wavelength, we are confident that our measurements represent a robust minimum. We also cannot say whether aggradation or deflation has taken place along the line, but the fact that our marker plants remained recoverable suggests that local vertical changes are likely <10 cm. Our survey values should be accurate to <0.5 cm, both vertically and horizontally.  The data show average wavelengths and ripple amplitudes of 394 cm and 23 cm, respectively, in 2004, and 420 and 13 cm in 2005.  Ripple crests moved an average of 293 cm to the east during one year, with slightly larger movement at the western end of the line than the eastern end. This is the first documented rate of granule ripple movement that we are aware of. In 2005, we surveyed three new lines where we left flagging at the survey line endpoints (with the permission of the Park Service personnel), and we also documented the survey locations using DGPS equipment, which should allow us to recover the line points to <2 cm [9], should the flagging be gone. Park personnel have also offered to photograph these new sites every month or so, which should give us  the documentation required to assess whether more than one wavelength of motion has taken place between surveys.  Park personnel also have weather records that should allow us to relate the documented movement to wind regimes within the park. Ripples/Dunes on Mars:  New imaging data reveal that transverse aeolian ridges (TARs), a generic term for wind-generated landforms that might be either ripples or dunes [10], are present on Mars over a wide range of scales.  Recent Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) narrow angle (NA) images show a great diversity of TAR wavelengths (e.g. Fig. 3); our Figure 3.

NASA/JPL/MSSS. surveys of MOC NA images to date show TAR wavelengths ranging from ~20 m to >300 m; the latter almost certainly represents dunes rather than ripples.  At the same time, the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) Spirit and Opportunity are both finding ripples and dunes at scales that overlap the smallest aeolian features seen from orbit [11, 12]. For example, features that must be related to ripple processes are seen superposed on larger features that are most likely granule ripples (Fig. 4), based on inferences derived from both rovers [11, 12]. Particulate Movement Processes:  These results should help to refine our understanding of windrelated particulate motion on Mars.  Dust (silt and clay size fractions) is clearly put into suspension and distributed around the entire planet, while rocks (cobbles and larger) are too massive to be moved by wind and instead show signs of wind erosion (ventifacts) [e.g., 13].  Granules-sized materials have Figure 4. Portion of MER PanCam image showing ripple features at multiple scales, "El Dorado" feature on Husband Hill.

NASA/JPL/Cornell. been documented on aeolian ripples by the Microscopic Imager on both rovers [14, 11, 12], so that the granule ripples at GSDNP are good analogs to many features on Mars.  Sand (most likely basaltic in composition) [11], remains the primary agent to mobilize the granule-sized materials by impact creep, to abraid the immovable rocks, and to form dunes where the sand supply and the wind is sufficient. Future work will focus on trying to improve our understanding of cm-to-m-scale aeolian features on Mars through measurement of dimensions (and other properties) for features on Earth that could aid in clarifying the contributions to particulate movement from various wind-related mechanisms.
