Proposed hydrothermal environments include: acid-sulfate fluids [1,2,3], acid fumarolic condensates [2], or Cl-rich near-neutral hot springs [5,6]. Amorphous silica can form under varied hydrothermal conditions: residual enrichment of silica by solfataric leaching; or direct precipitation from neutral to alkaline thermal fluids. The contrasting textural and geochemical properties of silica-rich deposits on Earth deposited by these end member processes are subtle, but provide clues to conditions present at the time of deposition near Home Plate. At Geysir geothermal field, SW Iceland, we can compare volcanic hydrothermal alteration products produced under different conditions within the same hydrothermal system on an equivalent spatial scale to that of the proposed hydrothermal features near Home Plate. Geysir hosts active boiling Cl-rich near-neutral hot springs within ~100m of solfataric fumaroles, which form silica-rich alteration products through different hydrothermal processes. Results of a preliminary study of alteration products at Geysir are reported herein to help constrain the depositional environment of silicarich outcrops/soils near Home Plate. Methods: Fluid and solid samples were collected from two hot springs in Geysir's main thermal field (SW), Blessi hot spring (central), an extinct hot spring (solids only, NE), and an active fumarole (solids only, NE)(Fig 1). Mineral phases were identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Focus XRD. Solid sediment and mineral samples were fused into glass and analyzed for bulk geochemistry using a Bruker S4 Pioneer X-ray fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer. Fluid samples were analyzed in situ with a Hydrolab sonde for pH, redox potential (ORP), salinity, and other parameters. Fluid samples were also pumped directly from beneath the surface of hot springs with a peristaltic pump, filtered in-line, and stored under N2-gas for later major anion and cation analysis. Cation samples were acidified in-line with ~ 1 ml 2 N HNO3 for storage. Future work will characterize major and trace element geochemistry and quantify total sulfide present in fluids. Hydrolab results: Surface fluids sampled were subboiling (~90°C) and relatively dilute, with pH ranging from mildly acidic (4.5) to subalkaline (8.5). Hydrolab data reveal mildly oxidizing to oxic conditions (Eh 224540 mV) and relatively dilute fluids (salinity < 1 ppt; SpCon ~ 1 mS/cm).  XRD results: XRD results are reported in Table 1. A piece of unaltered rhyolite collected from the margin of the thermal field indicate that quartz, sanidine, and albite are leading primary phases. Samples collected adjacent to the active fumarole were dominated by amorphous silica, Fe-oxides (hematite), and kaolinite, with anatase (TiO2) often also present. Elemental sulfur was a minor component in only one sample in direct contact with fumarole steam. The presence of ferric oxides was noted in all fumarole samples except for one sample collected from ~4 cm depth, where pyrite was instead identified, indicating a depth-dependent redox gradient. Sulfates, observed in surface crusts several meters away from the sampled fumarole where steam emerged from cracks in a gully, include hydrous Casulfates (bassanite and anhydrite) and mixed-cation sulfates (Al/Fe/Mg-sulfates (pickeringite/halotrichite and hexahydrite). Actively precipitating sinters collected from the margin of near-neutral hot springs were dominated by amorphous silica, and in some cases contained calcite and/or minor kaolinite. One sample also contained detrital igneous phases (sanidine and quartz), likely reflecting incorporation of local sand. Fossil sinters associated with extinct hot springs contained amorphous silica along with crystalline silica phases such as tridymite, quartz, and opal-A, suggesting Figure 1: Map showing relative location of hot springs/fumaroles at Geysir geothermal field, Iceland. White scale bar is 250 m across. Inset map shows location of field site in Iceland. Satellite imagery provided by [7] increased diagenetic maturation. Tibearing phases were not identified in any sinter precipitates.  XRF results: XRF data is reported in Table 2. Sinter precipitates collected adjacent to active and extinct near-neutral hot springs had enriched silica, in some cases >90 wt.%. Al2O3 and Fe2O3 were the second most abundant elements, in the 1-3 wt.% range, with Ti-, Mn-, Mg-, Ca-, Na-, and K-oxides uniformly present but generally at <1 wt.%. Samples collected adjacent to fumaroles where leaching dominated the alteration regime generally showed enrichment Si-, Al-, Fe-, Mg-, and Ti-oxides and were also enriched in trace elements Ni, Cr, and V relative to the rhyolitic substrate. All other major oxides were generally depleted in leached samples. Discussion: Results indicate that acid-leaching concentrates TiO2 while direct precipitation from neutral/alkaline fluids does not. TiO2 wt.% values were about ten times higher in leached rocks than in sinter precipitates, and anatase was identified in most leached rocks/ sediments but absent in the sinters. Contamination of detrital phases may have incorporated some Ti into sinters, somewhat elevating Ti values in the XRF analysis. Crystalline silica phases such as opal-A, tridymite, and quartz occurred in more diagenetically mature samples, from an extinct hot spring. Near fumaroles, mineralogy was largely controlled by acid-steam alteration of host rocks or sediments, which left behind residual amorphous silica, TiO2 (anatase), Fe-oxides, and kaolinite clay and enriched Ni, V, and Cr. A shallow redox gradient was also observed, indicated by the presence of pyrite and absence of ferric oxides at depth. The Geysir geothermal system is considered a mature system [8], and the present alteration regime could be overprinting previous episodes of alteration. The rhyolite substrate sampled therefore may not reflect the parent material of altered sediments analyzed here. Revisiting Home Plate: [5] argues that Ti enrichment in 'Gertrude Weiss' soils excavated by MER Spirit's broken wheel near Home Plate cannot alone constrain an acid leaching history. However, TiO2 enrichment > 1 wt.% coupled with enrichment in SiO2, Ni, and Cr (observed at Geysir and in Gertrude Weiss soils; [1]) favors acid leaching over sinter precipitation. A lack of S-bearing phases in Gertrude Weiss soils is also cited as evidence in favor of sinter deposition, but most fumarole samples from Geysir also lacked Sbearing phases (except elemental S at the source, and pyrite at depth), likely indicating that soluble sulfate phases are readily re-dissolved and removed from the system.
