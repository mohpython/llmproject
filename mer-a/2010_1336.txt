So far, Martian basalts are constrained to four time spans from near present day to earliest Mars (Fig 1). 1) Basaltic volcanism as recently as ~10 Ma [e.g., 1] and uplift of the Tharsis bulge [2] indicate mantle melt extraction is ongoing.  2) Crystallization ages of shergottitic meteorites range from 173 to 575 Ma [3, 4]. 3) The surface age estimates of basalts examined in Gusev Crater by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit are Early Hesperian (~3.7 Ga) [5]. And 4) early mantle depletion suggested by shergottite Sm-Nd isotopes likely occurred within the first 33 m.y. of Mars history [6].  The Wänke and Dreibus (1988) estimate (WD) of bulk Mars approximates the ~4.6 Ga mantle [7].      Fig 1. Timeline of crystallization ages of shergottites and the surface ages of Gusev basalts and most recent volcanism.  Comparing geochemical datasets: Of the Martian basalts, compositional datasets exist for the shergottites [8] and the Gusev Crater basalts [9, 10]. Although the Gusev data are more limited, the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer (APXS) analyses include minor elements whose behavior during mantle melting ranges from highly incompatible (K and P) to highly compatible (Cr and Ni).  In order to evaluate patterns in elemental concentrations, we plot whole rock analyses for Martian basalts on a chondrite-normalized abundance diagram or "spider diagram" (Fig 2) that lists elements in order of increasing compatibility during (terrestrial) mantle melting. All shergottites are depleted in K. Some shergottites are also depleted in light rare earth elements (REE) relative to heavy REE, such as QUE 94201  with steep patterns (Fig 2A) that probably result from partial melting of a mantle reservoir that was depleted in light REE early in Mars history [6]. Other shergottites, such as Los Angeles, are more light REE-rich and have flatter patterns that likely result from fractional crystallization and assimilation of a light REE-rich reservoir, such as the crust [11].   Although not all elements are included, overlaying the Gusev basalt data in Fig 2B demonstrates two main basalt groups: 1) Adirondack with lower, but increasing normalized concentrations of the incompatible elements K, P, and Ti, resulting in a steep pattern and 2) Columbia Hills (CH) basalts (Backstay, HumboldtPeak, and Irvine) with flatter incompatible element patterns (higher K/Ti). Differences in K, P, and Ti were likely not caused by Mars surface processes because these elements are not enriched in soil and dust and they do not correlate with other indices of alteration, such as Si/Al [10]. Instead, the origin of differences among the Gusev basalts can be linked to differences in their mantle source. Gusev basalts have higher CaO/Al2O3 than the shergottites and are thought to originate from a separate mantle source [e.g., 12].    Fig 2. C1 chondrite [13] normalized element abundance (spider) diagrams for A: basaltic and olivine-phyric shergottites [8] and B: Gusev basalts [9, 10].  The origin of Gusev basalts: We focus on the minor elements (K, P, Ti, Cr, Ni) to model igneous processes based on known partition coefficients (D).  For example, Rayleigh fractional crystallization of Adirondack magma steadily increases incompatible element concentrations (K; ! D Kbulk " 0) and rapidly decreases compatible element concentrations (Ni; ! D Ni bulk >>1).  After 50% crystallization, the increase in K is too small (0.13-0.25 wt% K2O) and the decrease in Ni is too great (149-5 ppm) for Adirondack to be parental to CH basalts as suggested by [14].  Our preferred model for the origin of the Gusev basalts involves two-stage batch melting of WD mantle (Fig 3); the primary reservoir melts to produce a (Krich) magma like the CH basalts, leaving behind a depleted (K-poor) mantle reservoir that then melts a second time to produce a more depleted (K-poorer) Adirondack-like magma. Partition coefficients reflect 1 GPa phase assemblage of [11].       Fig 3. Two-stage batch melting of a WD mantle at F=0.03 and 0.10 plotted on a C1 chondrite [13] normalized K-P-Ti-Cr-Ni abundance diagram.  It is unlikely the same parcel of mantle melted to form all Gusev basalts.  Instead, the CH basalts originated by melting a primary mantle reservoir, while Adirondack basalts came from a reservoir that had previously been partially melted. Importantly, primary WD mantle must have existed at least until the Hesperian (~3.7 Ga), indicating early light REE depletion of the shergottite mantle source was not uniform. The Evolution of the Martian Mantle: To address how volumes of primitive and depleted reservoirs in the Martian mantle may have varied with time, we present a mass balance model of coupled crustal growth and mantle depletion (Fig 4). Assuming no crustal recycling, our model involves three reservoirs: the crust and two mantle reservoirs - a K-rich, primitive mantle (PM) of WD composition [7] and a Kpoor, depleted mantle (DM). A volume of fertile PM partially melts at melt fraction F (F=0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) to generate volumes of DM and crust, where the total volume of the crust and the mantle is constant. A significant unknown is the thickness of the crust because as it thickens, a greater portion of the mantle is involved in its production. We use a mean crustal thickness of 40-50 km based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) topography and gravity models [15]. It is impossible to constrain crustal growth rates because we lack absolute ages or information about the subsurface.  Instead, we assume the bulk of the Martian crust was built by the Noachian (within first 1 Ga). The volume of Amazonian age crust was determined using surface area estimates of Amazonian volcanic rocks [16] and assuming 5 km associated underlying crust. We estimated the volume of Hesperian crust by averaging volumes of Noachian and Amazonian crust.  In sum, we estimate the total crustal thickness added since the Noachian is <1 km.               Fig 4. Mass balance model of the evolution of the Martian crust and mantle since the formation of the planet (time=0) to the present day.  In order for PM to persist to the Hesperian, as indicated by the CH basalts, a high degree of mantle partial melting (F>0.05) must account for crust formation. Thermal models [2] suggest that in order for mantle convection to support the Tharsis uplift today, ~50% of radioactive elements (including K) presently reside in the Martian mantle.  If all heat-producing elements are in PM domains, then PM makes up at least 10-15% of the present mantle volume.  A possible solution is 4050 km crust was created by ~10% partial melting of the mantle, leaving ~20% primary WD mantle.  The Martian crust likely formed by inhomogeneous, multistage partial melting of the mantle as suggested for the Gusev basalts.  However, our model demonstrates that at high melt fractions (F>0.05), heterogeneities in the mantle formed by incomplete melt extraction, may persist over the history of Mars.
