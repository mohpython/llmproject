Introduction: The primary oxygen fugacity of basaltic melts is important because it dictates the crystallizing assemblage and how the magma will evolve. In addition, magmatic fO2 reflects the oxidation state of its mantle source.  On Earth, variability of fO2 among basaltic melts is linked to mass exchange between the surface and the interior during tectonic processes [e.g., 1]. On Mars, certain shergottitic meteorites (NWA 1110) exhibit up to 2-3 log units fO2 between early and late crystallizing assemblages [2, 3] and are thought to reflect mixing between melts derived from reduced (mantle) and more oxidized (late-stage fractionated, i.e., crustal) reservoirs.  Alternatively, fO2 variability may originate by multi-stage partial melt extraction [4] and development of a more reduced residual mantle.  Measured Fe3+/FeT of Gusev Basalts: Basaltic rocks encountered by the Spirit rover in Gusev Crater are diverse and range from the K-poor Adirondack class (0.02 wt% K2O) to K-rich Backstay and Irvine classes (up to 1.2 wt% K2O [5]).  The Barnhill class includes altered pyroclastic rocks of similar composition to Irvine [5]. Mineral contents also vary with olivine/pyroxene ratios ranging 1.42 to 0.09 for the Adirondack and Irvine classes, respectively [6, 7]).   Examination of rock surfaces by Mössbauer spectrometer provides in situ Fe3+/FeT observations [6, 7].  These observations are too high to be the primary magmatic Fe3+/FeT because they include secondary Fe3+ oxides (hematite and nanophase Fe-oxide, NpOx) that likely formed by low temperature alteration near the Martian surface.  Even the relatively reduced Humphrey contains ~9% secondary Fe3+ oxides.    Table 1.

Normative mineralogy. Calculations of CIPW norms using measured Fe3+/FeT do not match mineral contents observed by Mössbauer or by Mini-TES [9].  To address this, McSween et al. [9] set Fe-bearing minerals at Mössbauer ratios and then calculated normative proportions for the remaining non-Fe-minerals.   Some high Fe3+/FeT targets, such as Barnhill_Ace (Fig. 1), are not olivine normative, even though Mössbauer analysis indicates olivine makes up 17% of the rock [9].  This significant discrepancy is caused by the strong dependence of CIPW norms on input Fe3+/FeT ratios. Secondary Fe3+ oxide minerals make up ~17% of the Barnhill_Ace, indicating pervasive alteration at the Martian surface.   Fig 1. Calculated normative mineral contents for Barnhill_Ace by two different methods using measured Fe3+/FeT.    Fe3+/FeT by Igneous Minerals: To estimate the magmatic fO2, we calculated Fe3+/FeT for the igneous minerals (olivine, pyroxene, and magnetite) determined by Mössbauer [5, 6].  Because the crystals are typically less oxidized than the magma (crystals+melt), values in Table 2 should represent minimum fO2 estimates, unless igneous minerals were affected by later alteration.   Table 2. Fe3+/FeT and ΔQFM of Igneous minerals  Fe3+/FeT ΔQFM* Adirondack 0.05 -3.6 Humphrey (Adirondack class) 0.07 -3.1 Backstay 0.06 -3.6 Irvine 0.19 -0.5 Esperanza (Irvine class) 0.26 0.5 Barnhill_Ace 0.17 -0.9 Posey (Barnhill class) 0.22 -0.2 JamesCoolPappaBell (Barnhill class) 0.18 -0.6 *ΔQFM calculated as in Table 1.  Fe3+/FeT by Normative Mineralogy: As a third method to estimate primary fO2, we took advantage of  the dependance of CIPW normative mineralogy on Fe3+/FeT (Fig. 2); we determined at what Fe3+/FeT the CIPW normative olivine/hypersthene (ol/hy) ratio equals the ratio of olivine/pyroxene as measured by Mössbauer [6, 7].  In doing so, we assume that measured olivine/pyroxene ratios are magmatic (i.e., no olivine dissolution or later alteration).  Fig 2. Method to determine Fe3+/FeT by using normative olivine/hypersthene ratio for the target Backstay.  At olivine/hyphersthene of 0.95, Fe3+/FeT=0.15.  Table 3. Fe3+/FeT and ΔQFM by normative ol/hy  Fe3+/FeT ΔQFM* Adirondack 0.12 -1.6 Humphrey (Adirondack class) 0.12 -1.7 Backstay 0.15 -1.4 Irvine 0.24 0.2 Esperanza (Irvine class) 0.28 0.7 Barnhill_Ace 0.12 -1.7 Posey (Barnhill class) 0.12 -1.9 JamesCoolPappaBell (Barnhill class) 0.12 -1.8 *ΔQFM calculated as in Table 1. The fO2 of Barnhill class rocks by the normative ol/hy method is lower than is indicated by the igneous minerals (Table 2). The igneous minerals in Barnhill class may not be at magmatic proportions (e.g. excess magnetite). A high proportion of NpOx in Barnhill class rocks (up to 30% of Mössbauer spectral area [7]) indicates pervasive alteration [10]. Under oxidizing, acidic conditions, olivine dissolves more rapidly than pyroxene [11], affecting the observed olivine/pyroxene ratio in weathering rinds of Gusev basalts [12].   The fO2 values determined by normative ol/hy thus should represent maximum estimates.   Comparison of fO2 of Martian Basalts: The oxidation states of the K-poor Adirondack and K-rich Backstay class basalts are like one another even though their magmatic compositions are distinct [4]. Furthermore, fO2 as measured by their igneous minerals overlaps with the more reduced shergottites (Fig 3).  The oxidation states of these basalts may reflect their derivation from similarly reduced mantle sources.   The Irvine class basalts are more oxidized than the other Gusev basalts. The fO2 values of Irvine and Esperanza as indicated by igneous minerals and normative ol/hy being are similar to the late-stage assemblage of the shergottite NWA 1110 [2, 3].  We interpret this to indicate tapping of a more oxidized mantle source, assimilation of an oxidized "crust" as suggested by [2], or later alteration, such as silicification of olivine to produce excess pyroxene and magnetite [10].      Fig 3. Complilation of primary fO2 estimates for the Gusev basalts and shergottitic meteorites.   Conclusions: In all cases, bulk rock Fe3+/FeT Mössbauer measurements (Table 1) yield higher Fe3+/FeT than the other methods (Tables 2 and 3). All samples show evidence of surface alteration (e.g., the presence of nanophase Fe-oxides [6, 7]). Estimates of primary fO2 for the olivine-rich Adirondack and Backstay classes are similar to the more reduced shergottites, perhaps implying a similarly reduced mantle source. Higher fO2 of the Irvine class may indicate partial melting of a more oxidized mantle reservoir, crustal assimilation, or interaction with oxidizing fluids.  General similarly of the fO2 between the Gusev basalts and the shergottitic meteorites indicates that the range  of fO2 of the Martian mantle and igneous rocks is relatively restricted.  Tectonic processes have not led to sufficient recycling of oxidized surface material into the Martian interior to significantly affect the oxidation state of the mantle. References: [1] Kelley, K.
