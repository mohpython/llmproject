Introduction:  Observations made by the Opportunity rover during its traverse south from Eagle crater show that the hematite bearing plains are an aeolian lag deposit consisting of hematite spherules and  basaltic sand, along with a nanophase iron oxide bearing dust component, that has been worked into ripples [1,2,3]. The hematite spherules, which have weathered out of the sulfate rich outcrop material that underlies the lag deposit, are concentrated at the surface [1,2,3,4,5].  It is this hematite bearing lag deposit that dominates the orbital signature in the vicinity of the landing site.  However, the orbital signature changes gradually along Opportunity's traverse to the south.  The albedo of the plains material as seen in a MOC narrow angle image (figs. 1 and 2) increases along the traverse south before the mottled terrain is encountered.  The thermal inertia of the higher albedo plains area decreases relative to the lower albedo plains (fig. 3) and the red to blue ratio as detected by the Mars Express OMEGA spectrometer increases to the south [6].  Systematic pancam foreground observations collected by the rover with a consistent viewing geometry also show an increase in the red to blue ratio as Opportunity traversed south.  This change in the nature of the lag deposit from the lower albedo plains to the higher albedo plains is consistent with  the incorporation of an increased amount of nanophase ferric iron oxide bearing dust derived locally from outcrop material.   Opportunity Traverse:  Although orbital remote sensing data (fig. 1) covers the traverse from Endurance to Erebus crater, Pancam analysis was focused on the portion of the traverse between the heat shield (sol 358), situated in the lower albedo plains, and purgatory dune (sol 447), which is located in the higher albedo plains (fig. 1).  The mottled terrain to the south, in which areas of underlying etched terrain materials are exposed and is visible in the vicinity of Erebus (fig. 1) also corresponds to an area of higher thermal inertia (fig. 3).  Several OMEGA pixels also cover Opportunity's traverse [6].  For the portion of the traverse between the heat shield and purgatory dune, the route toward Erebus crater was punctuated by stopping at crater waypoints.  However, large legs of the traverse occurred in between the craters.  Along the traverse, systematic foreground observations were often acquired by the pancam to image the plains material Pancam Foreground Observations: The systematic pancam foreground observations document the plains material as Opportunity traversed south from the lower albedo plains through the higher albedo plains.  The post drive foreground observation was generally pointed to acquire an image of the soil directly in front of the rover.  Therefore, the foreground images were acquired at a consistent emission angle of ~36 degrees, although the incidence and phase angle vary among observations.  Although the plains are heterogeneous at a small scale with respect to ripple crest and interripple trough areas [2,7], because the foreground observations were generally not preferentially targeted, they represent a somewhat random sample of the plains material along the traverse. Method:  In order to quantify changes in the plains deposits as Opportunity traversed south, the average pancam spectrum, in units of I/F [8], was determined for each foreground image.  A red to blue ratio for each image was calculated by dividing the average value of the ~753nm (L2) band by the average value of the ~440nm (L7) band.  The approximate location of each observation along the traverse was determined (fig. 1) and the approximate distance from Endurance crater was also measured.  Figure 4 shows the distance from Endurance crater versus the average red to blue ratio for each foreground image, with the exception of the three foreground images that were acquired at the rim of a crater (beige in fig. 1).  These observations were omitted from the plot because they are not representative of the plains lag deposit material.   Albedo data between Endurance crater and Erebus crater were extracted from the MOC NA image and plotted as a function of distance (fig. 2).  A thermal inertia map covering the traverse was generated using THEMIS spectral radiance at 12.57µm to estimate the kinetic surface temperature followed by the interpolation of a seven dimensional look up table based on [9] and [10].  The thermal inertia data were also extracted and plotted as a function of distance from Endurance crater (fig. 3).   Discussion:  The Pancam spectrum of outcrop material has a steep slope from the near UV through VIS bands that is indicative of the presence of a nanophase ferric iron oxide bearing phase [4 and references therein].  This fine grained nanophase iron oxide dust is generally interpreted to be derived from the outcrop material rather than from wind fall deposits [1,3,4].  There is a broad increase in the red to blue  ratio in the average pancam foreground spectra as the lower albedo plains grade into the higher albedo plains.  This indicates that there is an increase in the nanophase  ferric oxide or dust component in the spectra from the higher albedo plains.  The mössbauer spectrometer also measured an increase in the nanophase iron oxide component as seen in the purgatory trench soil compared to the soil in a trench carried out further to the north on sol ~372 [6].   This increase in nanophase ferric oxide could be derived from the proximal exposures of outcrop seen in the mottled terrain.  The friable outcrop material is easily eroded and mobilized [3].  The higher albedo plains material is likely the result of mixing of the lower albedo plains material with nanophase ferric iron oxide dust derived from the exposures of etched terrain to the south.  Other evidence supports the importance of locally derived material as input into the plains lag deposit.  As Opportunity traversed south, inspection of the foreground images shows a decrease in the size of the hematite spherules.  Measurements carried out by [7] show that the hematite spherules measured in the outcrop of Vostok crater are approximately half the size of the spherules measured in Endurance crater.  Although the smaller spherules seen during the traverse south may be the result of abrasion, a smaller  population of spherules derived from the local outcrop is a plausible explanation for the smaller population of spherules observed in the plains [7]. Conclusion:  The coordinated analysis of orbital and ground truth data from the Opportunity rover traverse suggests that the change in nature of the plains lag deposit from the lower albedo plains to the higher albedo plains, which includes an increase in albedo; decrease in thermal inertia; and increase in the red to blue ratio in the OMEGA data as well as in the pancam systematic foreground images, is consistent with  the incorporation of an increased amount of nanophase ferric iron bearing dust derived locally from outcrop material exposed in the mottled terrain to the south.
