Introduction:  The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit has recently discovered silica-rich and Fe-sulfate rich materials in the Inner Basin of the Columbia Hills, Gusev Crater, Mars [1,2].  These deposits occur as anomalously bright white and yellow soil exposures within Spirit's wheel tracks.  Based on repeated observations of the Tyrone sulfate soil deposit with Spirit's Pancam multispectral imager [3], Wang et al. [4] suggest that the "yellow" soil may have changed spectrally with time. Wang et al. [4] propose that the observed changes may be due to the dehydration of Fesulfate species upon exposure to the martian surface. To better understand the stability of silica-rich and Fe-sulfate materials under current martian surface conditions, and to quantify the spectral changes accompanying their dehydration, we have subjected samples of  silica sinter (opal-A), rhomboclase, copiapite, coquimbite, and fibroferrite to long-duration (since Aug. 2008) simulated martian T, P and UV conditions. Experimental procedure: The samples were ground and sieved to <45 !m and exposed to simulated Mars surface conditions using the University of Winnipeg's miniature Mars Environment (mini-ME) chamber [5]. A constant atmospheric pressure was maintained at 660 Pa CO2 (0.0065 atm; 5 Torr), and the sample temperature was restricted to a maximum close to maximum surface temperatures on present-day Mars (~20 oC), as described by [6]. We note that the partial pressure of water vapor (pH2O) was not monitored during the experiment; however a constant supply of dry CO2 was supplied to the samples and Mars atmospheric pressure maintained with the vacuum pump.  Reflectance spectra were measured with an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro HR spectrometer (at a viewing geometry of i=0° and e=0° using a bifurcated probe) through a 10 mm-thick sapphire window. Sample spectra were measured relative to a Spectralon® standard and corrected for minor (<2%) irregularities in its absolute reflectance. Spectra were collected every few days for the first month, and then on a roughly monthly basis (19 spectra acquired over 442 day of exposure).  After the sample appeared to have equilibrated to 5 Torr CO2 conditions (i.e., when spectral differences between measurements were no longer observed), we irradiated the sample with UV light using a 25 W deuterium lamp. The incident UV radiation during one day of laboratory irradiation was determined to approximately equal one decade of UV radiation as presently received on the martian surface [6].  UV irradiation began on day 259 of the experiment and ended when the power supply died on day 319. Since that time the samples have been maintained at the same conditions as at the start of the run but without UV irradiation. Silica sinter spectral changes:  Figure 1 shows the spectra of a natural silica sinter from Wairakei, NZ over 294 days of exposure to martian surface conditions. The major spectral features observed are two OH and H2O absorptions near 1400 nm, an H2O combination near 1900 nm, and an Si-OH libration plus stretching band near 2250 nm. The spectral changes include a rapid (~1 day) shift of the ~1400 nm absorption feature to shorter wavelengths and a more gradual decrease in the ~1900 nm absorption feature depth.  As the water bands diminish in intensity, the spectral minimum related to silanol at ~2250 nm becomes more distinct. Collectively these changes suggest a change in the form of the H2O (1400 nm feature), a loss of H2O (depth of 1900 nm feature), and a possible increase in silanol groups (appearance of 2250 nm feature). They also indicate that exposure of silica-rich materials to Mars surface conditions can have dramatic spectral effects due to loss and rearrangement (Si-OH bonding) of any preexisting H2O.   With the addition of UV irradiation, the trends in the spectral changes continue with the addition of an increased blue-to-red slope.   Figure 1.  Reflectance spectra (normalized at 1250 nm) of silica sinter over 294 days of 5 Torr CO2.           Figure 2. Reflectance spectra (normalized at 1250 nm) of Fe-sulfate samples over 294 days of 5 Torr CO2.        Fe-sulfate spectral changes:  Figure 2 shows the spectra of Fe-sulfate samples over 294 days of exposure to martian surface conditions. Copiapite. Changes include decreases in the depths of the ~1400 nm OH and ~1900 nm H2O features while the ~870 nm Fe3+ feature becomes less distinct. The addition of UV only affects the ~380 and ~430 nm features, which increase in band depth. The blue-to-red (432 to 753 nm) spectral slope decreases over the first ~100 sols of exposure, but increases again with addition of UV as the ~430 nm band depth increases. Coquimbite.  The ~1400 and ~1900 nm regions remain largely unchanged, implying that significant amounts of OH and H2O are not lost. The ~430 Fe3+ band depth increases, however, causing the blue-to-red slope to increase. Fibroferrite. Changes include decreases in OH and H2O band intensities, and the shape of 1900-2100 nm feature changes while its band center shifts to longer wavelengths (suggestive of multiple H2O sites undergoing differential loss). The OH and H2O bands are not affected further by UV, although all Fe3+ bands show accelerated change.  Rhomboclase.  A loss of the ~1750 nm OH band is observed, as are modifications of characteristic Fe3+ bands. The ~430 nm and ~790 nm features become less distinct, affecting the overall blue-to-red slope; when convolved to Pancam band passes, the 432 to 753 nm slope decreases by 43% over the first ~150 days of exposure. Fe-sulfates discussion: The major changes accompanying exposure to Mars surface conditions include changes in depth and wavelength position of OH and H2O features (~1400 and 1900 nm). The changes can be ascribed to various causes: differential loss of OH vs. H2O or OH/H2O located in multiple sites. Changes in the visible region can be more dramatic. These changes include appearance of new bands, disappearance of existing bands, band position shifts, and changes in overall slope (as a consequence of these changes in absorption bands). These spectral changes are likely linked to the aforementioned OH/H2O behavior, as the Fe3+ absorption bands are mediated by OH/H2O and crystal structure (which may change as OH/H2O are liberated). These and existing results [6] can be used to constrain the identity of constituent minerals in exposed soils that exhibit changes in their Pancam spectral properties.  References: [1] Squyres S.
