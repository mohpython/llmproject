 USE OF CRISM OBSERVATIONS TO MAP CHANGES IN THE GUSEV PLAINS AND COLUMBIA HILLS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR A RETROSPECTIVE SURVEY OF CRISM AND SPIRIT-DERIVED MINERALOGY.  A. M. Zastrow and R. E. Arvidson, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Washington University in Saint Louis, MO, 63130 (zastrow@wunder.wustl.edu).   Introduction:  The Spirit Mars Exploration Rover landed on the plains of Gusev in 2004.  From its initial landing location, Spirit then traveled into the Columbia Hills region until one of the wheels was embedded in soft soil in 2009.  Along the traverse path, Spirit's suite of instruments identified an array of minerals, including iron oxides, olivine, pyroxenes, sulfates, hydrated silica, and carbonates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  This abstract describes a set of studies which set up a more in-depth analysis of mineralogy along the traverses using visible/near infrared (VNIR) observations from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Spirit results. Our preparatory work highlights the dynamic nature of the region due to wind erosion and deposition of dust and sands and is needed to understand how to use multiple CRISM scenes to interpret mineralogy.  Processing of CRISM Data and Coregistration with Spirit Traverse Path:  Eight CRISM scenes over the Columbia Hills were processed to single scattering albedos (SSA) using DISORT to remove gas and aerosol effects, followed by use of the iterative maximum log-likelihood method (MLM) as detailed in [6]. Data were then coregistered with CTX and HiRISE images and Spirit's traverses.  The CRISM scenes were acquired from 2006 to 2013 in three modes:  fullresolution targeted (FRT00003192, FRT0000B39C, FRT0000C9FB, and FRT0000CDA5), along-track oversampled (still labeled "FRT", FRT0001D678 and FRT0001FE00), and full-resolution short (FRS00027485 and FRS00029F44).  Seven of the CRISM observations have corresponding images from the CTX and three have corresponding HiRISE images. Coregistration with Spirit traverse.  Initially, the traverse shapefile and a HiRISE image were registered to the Mars global THEMIS basemap.  Following that, each of the CTX and HiRISE images corresponding to the CRISM observations were registered to the traverse.  The CRISM S-band and L-band data were then registered to their respective CTX and HiRISE images and spot-checked with the other CRISM observations to verify complete coregistration.  Where necessary, observations were re-registered.  Figure 1 shows the Spirit traverse path with the coregistered CRISM observation FRT00003192 in IR false color.  Figure 1.

Scene covers approximately 10 km in width and the Columbia Hills is the triangular feature in the scene.  CRISM Scene Change over Time:  Comparisons of CRISM observations taken at different times show extensive changes in surface spectral properties, which are directly related to the amount of dust cover on the surface.  For this abstract, we will discuss the differences between FRT00003192 acquired in 2006, and FRT0000C9FB acquired in 2008.   We mapped spectral changes between the two CRISM observations at the 1.5 μm and other bands into three different intervals of SSA differences:  between 0 and 0.025, between 0.025 and 0.05, and greater than 0.05.  In Fig. 2 red colors indicate that the SSA is higher in 2008 than in 2006 and blue colors indicate lower values. Overall albedo changes (both positive and negative) occur most significantly in the southern and western parts of the scene.  These changes are interpreted based on examination of spectra to be due to removal and deposition of dust (e.g., Fig. 3). In addition, the area directly around and including the Columbia Hills shows a predominately positive SSA changes associated with increased dust cover from 2006 to 2008. We note that both scenes were acquired during the winter season with similarly low atmospheric opacities. The main point is that the Columbia Hills change spectral properties with time, a fact that needs to be incorporated into analysis of mineralogy from spectral properties.    Figure 2.

Spirit's traverses are also shown.   Figure 3.  Mean of 100 spectra representative of the dusty plains and center of El Dorado Ripple Field within the Columbia Hills.  The ferrous silicate signature is evident in the latter spectrum. Ferrosilicate Detections:  For each CRISM observation, a complete suite of mineral parameter maps was generated. These products give a rough representation of minerals that are present in a given observation.  Examination of the summary products for the eight scenes showed that, in general, the Gusev plains and Columbia Hills region exhibit strong olivine and highCa pyroxene singatures and little indication of low-Ca pyroxene,  and hydrated phases (Fig. 4). The 2006 and 2008 data show that the mineralogy follows the same general pattern across both scenes.  Olivines are found on the plains, but predominately in the southern Columbia Hills.  High-Ca pyroxene is found throughout the region.  The lack of low-Ca pyroxene is consistent with the Hesperian age of the plains volcanism [7].  Both maps show the highest occurrence of these minerals in areas with lower SSA values, consistent with minimal dust cover.  Figure 4.  Comparison of mafic mineral maps (RGB: OLINDEX3, LCPINDEX2, HCPINDEX2, respectively, from [8]) for a) FRT00003192 and b) FRT0000C9FB, overlain by Spirit traverse in white. Differences in spatial patterns represent the dynamic nature of dust erosion and deposition for the plains and Columbia Hills.  Conclusions:  The Gusev plains and Columbia Hills is a dynamic region in terms of overall dust cover. At any given time, the region may be anywhere from entirely covered by dust to extremely clear.  From our comparisons of SSA changes and the mafic mineral maps, it is clear that the accuracy of mineral identification in this region in particular is directly proportional to the amount of dust cover and this factor changes from scene to scene.   Further Analysis:  Following this preliminary work, we plan to step along the Spirit traverse to correlate Spirit in-situ mineral identifications with inferences that can be made from analysis of CRSIM data.  This will include dust and mafic minerals on the plains, and possible mineral variations within the Columbia Hills wind-blown deposits and outcrops.  References:  [1] Morris, R. V. et al. (2006) J.
