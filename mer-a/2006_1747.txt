The Panoramic Camera (Pancam) multispectral, stereoscopic imaging systems on the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity [1] have acquired and downlinked more than 95,000 images (~9.5 GBytes of data) over more than 1400 combined sols of operation on Mars as of early January 2006.  These images include 18 large color panoramas on Spirit and 10 on Opportunity, 6 and 18 broadband albedo panoramas, more than 44 and 25 other large color mosaics, and 800 and 500 full 13filter multispectral sequences on each vehicle, respectively. These unprecedented high resolution multispectral imaging campaigns have allowed the MER team to characterize the geology and regionaland local-scale color and albedo along the rover traverses in Gusev crater and Meridiani Planum. Pancam observations have also played critical roles in rover driving decisions and choices of specific in situ instrument targets, supporting the discovery that liquid water at or near the surface was an important component of an early, perhaps habitable Mars.

Pancam multispectral imaging data sets during the first Mars year of rover operations are categorized in Table 1. The highestresolution (0.27 mrad/pixel) images constitute more than 90% of the Pancam data volume.  Thumbnail (small 64x64 pixel preview images), reference pixel, and Pancam calibration target images [1,2], which are critical for both tactical- and archival-timescale image quality and instrument health assessments and calibration of the images, are the largest numbers of images acquired but they represent less than 7% of the total Pancam data volume for each rover.  The team has been able to conduct a comprehensive atmospheric multispectral imaging and opacity campaign for the "cost" of only a few percent of the Pancam data volume. From a compositional perspective, the most useful Pancam data sets utilize all 13 "geology" filters to cover 11 distinct near-UV to near-IR wavelengths [1], and constitute 25% to 30% of the total Pancam data volume.  Updates on the number and type of Pancam image acquisitions are available at: http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/ merweb/mer_edr_counter.pl. 360° Panoramas.  We acquire large-scale multispectral panoramas to characterize the geologic context, topography, and regional-scale color properties of new locations along each rover's traverse path.  Where possible, these panoramas span the full 360° in azimuth around the rover (Table 2). However, power or data volume resource limitations often restrict large multispectral panorama coverage to less than the full 360°.  Dozens more of these large-scale mosaics (spanning 60° or more in azimuth) have been acquired on each rover.  All of the 360° color panoramas and many of the other large-format color mosaics are posted online at: http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/ panoramas.html.  This presentation will review the scientific results derived from large-format multispectral panoramas acquired during the past Earth year of rover operations. "Albedo" Panoramas.  The bolometric albedo of the terrain around the rover can be estimated for comparison to orbital-derived albedos using the Pancam left eye "empty" filter (739±338 nm) [1,2]. The albedo is estimated by dividing the calibration target-derived radiance factor values by the cosine of the solar incidence angle at the time of each observation [2].  Table 3 provides a summary of the albedo panoramas acquired to date from each rover. Many of these were acquired as part of dedicated "ground truth" campaigns associated with simultaneous or near-simultaneous observations between Pancam and instruments on the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Express orbiters or the Hubble Space Telescope. Spirit albedo results during the past Earth year of rover operations confirm a Gusev plains average albedo of 0.21±0.07 [3], comparable to the TES pixel albedo of 0.23±0.03 [4]. The large variance in the  average albedo is a result of the bimodal distribution of "dusty" (0.30) and "dark" (0.20) endmember albedos.  We observed a trend towards lower albedo values along the rover's traverse from the landing site to the Columbia Hills.  Once we arrived at the hills, they showed essentially the same bimodal distribution of albedos as observed in the plains. Table 2. Pancam Large Panoramas as of 9 Jan. 2006 Filters [1] Sols Name Az.

The average albedo of the dark basaltic and hematite-spherule rich plains materials has been observed to be constant along the traverse south to Erebus crater.  However, the variance of the albedo has been observed to increase as the relative percentage of bright (albedo ~0.3) sulfur-rich outcrop rocks in the field of view increases.  This result implies that the higher albedo "etched terrain" deposits further to the south [e.g., 6] may just be regions with significantly larger areal coverage by outcrop rocks. Table 3.
