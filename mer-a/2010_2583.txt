Introduction: Although there is currently little water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, and pure water is not stable at the surface, many features of the Martian landscape suggest that water was involved in their formation. Examples include hydrothermal salt deposits and mineral hydrates discovered on Mars by the rovers Spirit and Opportunity at the plateau, Home Plate [1]. In analogy with hydrothermal processes on Earth's seafloor, Martian hydrothermal processes may provide a mechanism for transporting water, chemicals, and energy to the surface, and hence affect Martian surface morphology. Additionally, linking hydrothermal processes and Martian surface morphology may provide a strategy for the search for life on Mars. Martian environmental properties are different from Earth's, yet the physical processes of diking and hydrothermal circulation on the two planets are similar. Models of hydrothermal systems as sources for Martian surface geomorphology have been performed on impact cratering e.g. [2],[3] and magma intrusions eg. [4],[5],[6]. Important parameters of fracturing and of fluid properties in hydrothermal systems including thermal expansion effects [7], tectonic stresses from dike propogation and effects of pore pressure change on fluid properties were not considered in previous hydrothermal models. The modeling performed here incorporates these properties and also investigates the melting of a layer of ice overlying the hydrothermal system. These models provide greater insight into dike-driven hydrothermal systems as possible formation mechanisms of Martian surface morphology. Dike Propagation: Fluid flow-like morphology observed on Mars may have formed as a result of magma-driven fluid flow processes below the surface [2,4-8]. In particular, Hanna and Phillips [5] investigated a system of an emplaced dike and the ensuing pore pressure distribution to determine if fluid could be rapidly forced to the surface to form flood features observed in the Mangala and Athabasca Valles. Here we study a similar system by analyzing a dike emplacement from the beginning of its propagation. The  program FRANC2D was employed to model an initial lens-shaped magmatic intrusion and the dike growth that resulted from overpressurizing the magma lens. Initially, a 10 km wide x 1 km thick magma lens is placed 20 km below the surface.  A load of 1% greater than the lithostatic pressure forces outwards from within the lens and a crack is started. Figure 1 depicts the initial geometry, boundary conditions and mesh.  The FRANC2D program then propogates the crack to the surface. During the propagation, stresses adjacent to the dike, both tectonic and thermal, and their effects on surrounding pore pressures are calculated. Figure 2 shows the propagated dike and how it's path leans towards the center of the magma lens.  The role of thermal stresses on permeability have not been considered in previous models of Martian magmahydrothermal systems. Pore pressure changes are then related to the adjacent hydrothermal system to determine resulting heat and fluid fluxes.   g 1% over lithostatic pressure Edge fixed in x & y Edge fixed in x Edge fixed in x 20 km Figure 1.

Magma lens and propagated dike within Martian subsurface  Overlying Ice Layer: A layer of ice or permafrost located above the hydrothermal system would slowly melt as heat from the system transfers to the ice.  Once this melt layer reaches a certain thickness, convection will occur.  Figure 3 shows the system configuration with the hot dike on the left transferring heat to the adjacent porous filled Martian subsurface.  The resulting boundary layer produces a heat flux along the base of the overlying ice layer.    Boundary layer, δ Hot dike Ice layer Boundary Layer, δ ll Porous medium Heat flux Figure 3. Hydrothermal system with hot dike transferring heat to adjacent porous medium and inducing circulation.  A boundary layer results and the resulting heat flux warms and melts the overlying ice layer.    The total energy supplied by the boundary layer over a time, τ, is expressed as:  δτρ vTcF wpw ,=              (1)  where F is the heat flux, ρw is the density of water, cp,w is the specific heat of water, 〈T〉 is the average temperature across the boundary layer thickness, δ, and 〈v〉 is the average velocity across the boundary layer thickness.  If the temperature of the overlying rock-ice layer is at the melt temperature, then, to a first approximation, this heat energy melts the ice and heats the resulting water-rock mixture. Assuming a constant porosity, φ, a horizontal dimension, l , and a thickness of the melt layer  h(τ), the flux is written as:  )())(( τφρρ hLTcF immm l+Δ=         (2)  where (ρc)m is the heat capacity of the water-ice mxiture, ρi is the density of ice, L is the latent heat of fusion,. and ΔTm is the temperature difference across the layer. The water-ice mixture heat capacity is defined as:   )1()( ,, φρφρρ −+= rprwpwm ccc  (3)  where ρr is the density of the rock and cp,r is the specific heat of the rock.   Setting equation (1) equal to equation (2) we can solve for the melt thickness, h, over a certain time, τ.   The melt layer thickness at which convection will begin occurs when the Rayleigh number, Ra, is greater than the critical Rayleigh number, Racr.  Ra for the porous medium containing the ice melt is:  λμκ αρ vTcKhg Ra wpw , 22 =                    (4)  where g is gravitational acceleration on Mars, ρm is the density of the porous medium, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of water, K is the permeability of the porous medium, λ is the thermal conductivity of ice, μ is the viscosity of water, and κ is the thermal diffusivity of ice.  For a porous medium with a heat flux at the base and a constant temperature ceiling, Racr is 27 [9].  Setting equation (4) equal to Racr and solving for h for a permeability of 1E-12 m2, the melt layer will begin convecting at a thickness of 15 m.  The time required to reach this thickness is calculated by using this value of h, setting equation (2) equal to equation (1) and then solving for τ.  Convection is found to occur after 1.75 years.   If the ice layer is melted through, the melt water will contribute to the volume of water released at the surface, helping to form the surface features observed on Mars. Alternatively, the melt layer may contirbute to destabilizing the the crust resulting in flow of the rock-meltwater mixture. Summary: The models and analyses performed here provide a more complete understanding of how thermal and tectonic stresses from dike propagation affect adjacent hydrothermal circulation, and how that circulation can provide heat to melt an overlying layer of ice and induce circulation.  Water flux from the hydrothermal system may then reach the surface and form observed morphology.  References: [1]Squyres, S. et al. (2008), Science, 320, 1063-1067. [2]Rathbun, J. and S.
