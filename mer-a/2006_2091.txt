Olivine is found in abundance in mafic and ultramafic igneous  rocks  on  Mars  [e.g.  4­6].  The  most  common solid  solution  series  for  this  mineral  of  varies  from forsterite (Mg2SiO4) to fayalite (Fe2SiO4). The Fo con­ tent  of  olivine  is  used  by  researchers  to  model  the petrogenesis  of  mafic  igneous  rocks,  such  as  the  pic­ ritic  basalts  of  the  Deccan  flood  basalt  province  on Earth [e.g. 7]. Following  the  discovery  of  picritic  basalts  in Gusev Crater by the Spirit rover [4], we set out to de­ velop  a  model  that  could  determine  the  Fo content of the  rocks  of  Gusev  via  Mini­TES  data  obtained  by MER.  The  shift  of  thermal  infrared  absorptions  to lower  wavenumbers  as  a  function  of  decreasing  Fo content  has  been  documented  [e.g.  9],  but,  to  our knowledge, the relationship has not been quantified to date. Such a model might have utility in the explana­ tion  of  the  origin  and  emplacement of mafic magmas that have covered much of the Spirit landing site area and  in  petrologic  analyses  of  orbital  remote  sensing data from olivine­rich exposures all over Mars. Analytical  Approach: The quantitative model we have  developed  for  determining  olivine  Fo  content from thermal emission spectra is based on fits to labo­ ratory  spectral  measurements  of    a  suite  of  olivine samples  ranging  in  composition  from  Fo­1  to  Fo­93. These  include  spectra  previously  measured  by  others [5,10]  and  ourselves.  Our  sample  suite  includes  1.) DA­1 (Fo­93) from dunite, Jackson Co., N.C., 2.) DA­ 4 (Fo­89) from Hawaiian olivine basalt, 3.) DA­6 (Fo­ 84) from the Bushveld intrusion, 4.) KI3054 (Fo­66) * , 5.) KI3189 (Fo­60) * , 6.) DA­8 (Fo­46) from the Bush­ veld  intrusion,  7.)  KI4143  (Fo­41) * ,  and  8.)  Fayalite (Fo­1) from ASU spectral library [10] ( * denotes spec­ tra from [5] converted from reflectance). For our sam­ ples  (labeled  "DA"),  olivine  grains  were  extracted from rocks by crushing and sieving to produce mineral grain samples between 710 and 1000 µm and washed with  ethanol  to  remove  clinging  fines.  Samples  were then  passed  through  a  magnetic  separator  in  an  at­ tempt  to  reduce  magnetite  contamination.  Olivine grains  were  hand­picked  to  ensure  purity.  Composi­ tions  were  determined  via  XRD  and  electron  probe analyses. Thermal infrared emission spectra were col­ lected  at  the  Mars  Space  Flight  Facility  at  Arizona State  University  using  the  methods  described  in  [11]. Our  sample  suite  is  supplemented  with  spectra  from the  ASU  spectral  library  [10]  and  those  provided  by Dr. Todd Hoefen of the USGS (converted from reflec­ tance spectra originally published in [5]). Positions of key  spectral  features  were  then  compared  to  Fo  con­ tent. We devoted our attention to the spectral features that  occur  between  300  cm ­1  and  600  cm ­1 ,  because these  are  features  least  affected  by  the  atmosphere  in remote  sensing  at  Mars.  As  noted  by  [5,6,10],  the spectral  signature  of  olivine  is  confirmed by the exis­ tence  of  three  prominent  spectral  features  in  this wavelength  range;  the  emissivity  minimum  near  400 cm ­1 , the emissivity maximum near 450 cm ­1 , and the emissivity minimum near 500 cm ­1 . The wavenumbers that  correspond  to  each  of  these  olivine  spectral  fea­ tures was identified by visual inspection. Results: Although the existence of all three spec­ tral features above are needed to confirm the presence of olivine in a TES or Mini­TES spectrum, our analy­ sis indicates that the absorption feature near 400 cm ­1 is  optimal for Fo determination.

This  model was then applied to Martian spectral data obtained from orbit and on the Martian surface by the Spirit  rover.  Spectra  analyzed  in  Table  1  represent whole rock data that have previously been determined to contain olivine spectral features [5,10]. These spec­ tra  were  analyzed  and  the  positions  of  the  prominent olivine absorption feature near 400 wavenumbers were visually  determined.  Although  the  spectral  sampling (10cm ­1 )  of  TES  and  Mini­TES  data  limits  the  preci­ sion  of  Fo  determination,  this  model  corroborates  the Fo content of olivines (Fo­60 to Fo­70) detected in the Nili  Fossae  region  of  Mars  by  the  Mars  Global  Sur­ veyor  [5,6].    When  then  applied  to  Mini­TES  data obtained  by  Spirit,  the  model  can  be  used  to  estimate the Fo content of olivines in the picritic basalts seen in Gusev Crater. Calculations for olivines in Gusev Cra­ ter  rocks  suggest  Fo  values  for  the  rock  named "Adi­ rondack" to be Fo­42, although the moderate sensitivi­ ties  of  both  orbital  TES  and  Spirit's  Mini­TES  intro­ duce uncertainty of up to +/­ 15Fo.

As additional data are obtained, we hope to be able to mathematically characterize the entire range of spectral features in the 300 to 600 cm ­1  wavenum­ ber range of olivine spectra. Our understanding of the spectral effects of varying olivine compositions will allow us to determine and map Fo values along Spirit's traverse across the plains of Gusev Crater and in the Columbia Hills.
