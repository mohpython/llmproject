 MINI-TES SPECTRA OF MAZATZAL AND OTHER ADIRONDACK-CLASS BASALTS IN GUSEV CRATER, MARS: SPECTRAL/MINERALOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR ALTERATION.   V. E.  Hamilton1 and S. W. Ruff2, 1Southwest Research Institute, 1050 Walnut St., Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302, hamilton@boulder.swri.edu, 2Arizona State University, Box 876305, Tempe, AZ 85287-6305, steve.ruff@asu.edu. Objectives:  Our two primary objectives are to use Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) data to determine the mineralogy of the alteration coating on the target Mazatzal [e.g., 1], and to determine if there is mineralogical evidence for sulfate-producing alteration of Adirondack-class rocks. Secondary objectives include identifying any Adirondack-class exotics on the plains or on the West Spur and verifying the assignment of basaltic exotics from the Colombia Hills to the Adirondack class. Background: The rock target informally referred to (as with all names here) as Adirondack is the type example of a class of basaltic rocks that were the first rocks analyzed by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit in Gusev crater [2]. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of Adirondack-class rocks with moderate to low dust cover acquired by the Mini-TES on Spirit are distinguishable from spectra of other rock classes by the presence of an emissivity peak at 430 cm-1 and a minimum near 510 cm-1, which are located in a spectral region least affected by atmospheric components and downwelling radiance and which are characteristic of olivine [3]. This is the only reported spectral class on the plains of Gusev crater.  However, spectra exhibiting similar low wavenumber spectral character have been identified along the rover traverse in the Columbia Hills and are referred to as exotics, as they cannot be linked to local outcrops [3]. Using Mini-TES data, [3] derived a mineralogy of approximately 20% plagioclase feldspar, 30% clinopyroxene,  40% olivine, and 10% high-silica glass for an Adirondack-class rock called Sarah.  However, chemical data of Adirondackclass rocks acquired by the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) exhibit an excess of sulfur [e.g., 4], suggesting the presence of sulfides or sulfates (usually assumed to be the latter; sulfides would need to be non-Fe-bearing to escape detection by the MÃ¶ssbauer spectrometer, MB). Therefore,  Mini-TES spectra of Adirondack-class rocks may contain evidence of sulfate phases, but this has not been studied. Data and Methods: We are examining the ~670 Mini-TES spectra acquired of rock targets on the Gusev plains and in the Columbia Hills through sol 710. Several of these spectra represent repeat views of the same target(s). Our quantitative mineralogical analysis is conducted using a linear least squares approach [3, 5]. We use the spectral library applied to the rock Sarah by [3], augmented with three Mg-Fe olivines [6] that were not available previously and the sulfates used by [3] in models of non-Adirondack-class rocks.  We have applied a correction for the presence of dust on the Mini-TES optics to spectra acquired after sol 420 [7]. The spectral effects of additional downwelling radiance, in cases where it is present, are modeled using a provisional correction [3]. Basaltic Exotics: Numerous float rocks first identified at the base of Husband Hill are termed "exotics" because they are surrounded by rocks of differing lithology [3]. "Basaltic exotics" are distinguished by their dark tone and texture, and several of these exhibit a prominent 430 cm-1 peak in the MIR that [3] used to attribute these rocks to the Adirondack class. In MiniTES spectra acquired prior to sol 710, we have identified 27 examples of Adirondack-class exotics. Here, for the first time, we describe two of these exotics on the West Spur:  Raster_rock (sol 203) and Chac (sol 258).  These show that rocks of the plains superpose and are younger than the rocks of the West Spur, in addition to being younger than the rocks of Husband Hill [8]. The average TIR spectrum of the remaining 25 rocks exhibits a strong resemblance to the average of the 11 best plains Adirondack-class spectra at all wavelengths (Fig.  1), giving us a high degree of confidence in assigning them to this class. We also searched the spectra of the plains rock targets for any features that could not be attributed to the Adirondack-class lithology with variable amounts of dust cover or downwelling radiance.  We found no evidence of non-Adirondack-class rocks on the plains. Evidence for Sulfate in Adirondack-Class Rocks:  We have used the spectral library described Fig. 1. Mini-TES spectra of basaltic exotics as compared to average high-quality Adirondack-class spectrum.  Vertical lines denote 510 and 430 cm-1 features. above to obtain preliminary mineralogies for five spectra: Sarah, the average of the 11 highest quality Adirondack-class spectra from the plains (AHQP), the average of all Adirondack-class rock spectra acquired on the plains (AP), the average of the Adirondack-class exotics from the Columbia Hills (ACHE), and the rock abrasion tool (RAT)-brushed surface of the rock Mazatzal (which exhibits a sulfur-enriched coating [4]).  The objectives are to determine whether variable atmospheric and surface dust influence model results, and if sulfates improve the best-fit models and may be components of this class of rocks. Our fit to Sarah (Fig. 2) includes sulfates (~20%) and has an RMS error that is improved (0.270%) vs. the fit obtained without sulfates (0.377%), suggesting that it is a plausible alternative mineralogy, if not a more accurate one (which depends on determining that the difference in RMS is greater than the noise in the data - an analysis we have not completed). In terms of its primary mineralogy, Sarah is modeled with pyroxene (~25%) + olivine (~25%) > plagioclase (~5%), and requires surface dust, slope, and sky components as in the model of [3], lending confidence to the result. Of particular note is that the amplitude of the low wavenumber spectral features (<600 cm-1) in Sarah is better modeled in our fit than in the fit of [3]. The AHQP, AP, and ACHE spectra all are modeled with sulfate components,  at abundances of ~25%, ~20%, and ~20%, respectively. The RMS values of these fits are all equivalent to or lower than the RMS values obtained for fits where spectra of sulfates are not included in the library. The primary mineralogies derived in these fits exhibit the anticipated relatively high olivine abundances, but also exhibit greater variation in those abundances (and in the fractions of other phases) than might be expected for rocks belonging to a common lithology. These variations may be a result of our attempt to model averages of spectra that were acquired under different atmospheric and temperature conditions. We are modeling individual rock target spectra to gain insight into this issue and to place additional constraints on the inclusion of sulfates. The best fit to the spectrum of the brushed surface of the rock Mazatzal (Fig. 3) contains ~5% sulfate, ~5% olivine and 10% magnetite. The most abundant phases modeled (80% of total) are glasses or have spectra similar to amorphous phases (i.e., zeolite).   The RMS error associated with this fit is comparable to that obtained with the spectral library that does not contain sulfates; this is not surprising, as sulfate is modeled at a relatively low percentage. The low modeled olivine abundance is consistent with the absence of the low wavenumber features at 510 and 430 cm-1. In summary, preliminary models of Mini-TES spectra of Adirondack-class rocks and their averages include sulfate, suggesting that it may be a discernible component of these rocks; currently, we are characterizing sulfate in individual targets. The coating on Mazatzal is dominated by amorphous phases with minor sulfate, magnetite, and olivine. The presence of  sulfate is consistent with APXS results [4], although by comparison to the modeled abundances for uncoated rocks, the abundance may be lower than expected for the relative sulfur enrichment observed by APXS.  Some magnetite is possible given MB results [9],  and low olivine is consistent with obscuration of the underlying basaltic lithology by the coating. References: [1] Squyres S.W. et al.
