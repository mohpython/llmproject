Introduction:  Since August 2011, Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been investigating the geology of western rim segments of 22 km diameter, Noachian-aged, degraded [1, 2], Endeavour Crater. She is currently located almost halfway down the back-wasted crater wall in Perseverance Valley, between Capes Tribulation and Byron [3] (Fig. 1). A unique lithology, the Matijevic formation that crops out in a small region on the inboard side of Cape York (Fig. 1), has been shown to be pre-Endeavour bedrock [4, 5]. The Matijevic formation is directly overlain by polymict breccias of the Shoemaker formation [5, 6]. We have interpreted a lower subunit of the Shoemaker formation on Cape Tribulation as distal ejecta from one or more pre-Endeavour craters [7]. Sulfate-sandstones of the Burns formation post-date Endeavour Crater [5]. The pre-Endeavour bedrock and associated alteration styles are discussed herein.  Noachian bedrock:  The Matijevic formation occurs as light-toned, planar outcrops with discontinuous, erosionally resistant dark veneers [4, 5]. The rocks are fine grained, with subrounded particles ≤0.3 mm in size, and they contain 1-4 mm-sized spherules in varying proportions. Apparent bedding in some outcrops is expressed as mm- to cm-scale planar laminations. Fine-grained clastic rocks can form by impact, explosive volcanic, aeolian, or fluvial/lacustrine processes; the limited exposures do not allow us to distinguish among these possibilities [5]. Endeavour rim rocks are basaltic-composition polymict breccias (Shoemaker formation) composed of 1-10 cm-sized, erosion-resistant clasts in a fine-grained matrix. Two texturally distinct breccias are present: a clast-poor unit with typically smaller clasts; a clastrich unit with generally coarser clasts [8]. Clast-poor breccias form planar, eroded outcrops, while the clastrich breccias are more resistant, forming ridge crests on Capes York and Tribulation. The walls of Marathon Valley document stratigraphic relationships between the two units: clast-rich breccias form the upper unit; clast-poor breccias occupy the valley floor [3]. Polymict breccias outside the tectonic rim of Ries Crater (equivalent to Opportunity's location) show no systematic vertical grain size variation in the deposit [9]. Polymict ejecta within the outer rim of Mistastin Crater are similarly poorly sorted [10]. Stratigraphic relationships between the lower and upper Shoemaker units do not match expectations for single-impact ejecta. Mean clast size and abundance decrease with radial distance outward in Ries and Meteor Crater ejecta, and in impact experiments [9, 11]. The stratigraphy in Marathon Valley is consistent with a lower unit of distal ejecta from one or more older craters overlain by proximal ejecta from Endeavour Crater. Investigations by Opportunity [7], and orbital observations of the walls of more youthful Bopolu and Iazu Craters to the south [1, 12], indicate the preBurns-formation bedrock in this region is part of the Noachian subdued crater unit that includes components of lava and pyroclastic flows, impact breccias, impact-melt sheets, and fluvio-lacustrine deposits [13]. Noachian alteration:  Several alteration episodes of Noachian to Early Hesperian age affected the Endeavour rim [4-6, 14, 15]. The oldest is Si-Al-rich vein formation in the Matijevic formation [15]. SilicaAl±Ge-rich veins occur as curvilinear red zones cutting the lower Shoemaker formation in the Marathon Valley region [16, 17]. A linear array of Si-Al-rich 50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2019 (LPI Contrib. No. 2132) pitted rocks occupy a fracture system in Perseverance Valley within an area of lower Shoemaker rocks [3, 18]. Based on our interpretation of the lower Shoemaker, all occurrences of crosscutting Si-Al-rich veins are in pre-Endeavour rocks [7], implying this alteration style was restricted to the Noachian bedrock. Endeavour rim rocks are basaltic in composition and overlap the Martian basalt field (Fig. 2). The "purple rocks" represent a fine-grained, homogeneous lithology of uncertain origin found scattered at several locations. They might be evolved igneous compositions, or an altered composition formed under low water/rock, acidic conditions (blue arrows; cf., [19]). The three lithologies that crosscut outcrops show evidence for compositional modification by alteration. The Lihir/Espérance veins that cut the Matijevic formation show the effects of alteration under higher water/rock conditions; two abraded targets plot nearest the field for terrestrial montmorillonites (Fig. 2). We interpreted the Lihir/Espérance veins to have formed as a mixture of montmorillonite and silica produced by moderate-temperature alteration of bedrock by circumneutral to mildly alkaline fluids [14]. The calculated end-member vein composition [14] plots within the montmorillonite field. Rocks from red zones show modest evidence for alteration; they are enriched in Al and Si, and sometimes Ge, compared to host bedrock [16]. One of the Perseverance Valley pitted rocks is similar to the purple rocks, while others express compositional evidence for alteration. The second oldest alteration event on Endeavour rim is low-water/rock alteration along the unconformity between the Matijevic and Shoemaker formations, forming veneers on the former. Ferric smectites are inferred to occur in these veneers [4], which post-date the Si-Al-rich veins [15]. Ferric smectites occur within the lower Shoemaker rocks of Marathon Valley [20], but their temporal relationship with the red zones has not been established. Thus, ferric smectites are associated with the pre-Endeavour bedrock. In the walls of Iazu Crater, ~25 km south of Endeavour, ferric smectites are observed in Noachian-aged basalticcomposition rocks underlying layered sulfates of the Burns formation [20], lending support to a Noachian age for ferric smectite alteration. Key findings:  Clast-poor, fine-grained breccias of the lower Shoemaker formation are identified as a preEndeavour lithology, expanding the extent of Noachian bedrock, and providing ground-truth for the orbitally-defined Noachian subdued crater unit. The oldest identified alteration event is formation of, Si-Al±Gerich veins by circumneutral to mildly alkaline hydrothermal fluids. Later ferric-smectite-formation is also confined to the regional bedrock. 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 010 20 30 40 50 60 010 20 30 40 50 60 basalts montmorillonite Al2 O 3  (m ole% )Ca O+ Na 2O+ K 2 O (m ol e% )MgO+FeOT (mole%) Espérance (calculated) pyroxene feldspars : olivine Shoemaker fm.
