Introduction:  Experiments are ongoing to assess a variety of questions regarding possible petrogenetic relationships among igneous rocks analyzed by the MER Rover Spirit as well as to assess possible links to the petrologic history of select SNC meteorites. Relating Humphrey and Wishstone: Silicasaturated alkalic rocks on Earth can be generated by crystallization of olivine tholeiite at the base of the continental crust.  [1] have shown experimentally that tholeiitic liquid with <0.35 wt% dissolved water can give rise to potassic silica-saturated alkalic ferrodioritic liquids at 9.3 kbar and that these liquids are low in silica and show strong Fe-Ti-P-enrichment.  Such liquids show major similarities to the APXS composition of the Columbia Hills Rock Wishstone [2] analyzed by the MER Spirit.  But can such trends be generated by a liquid of Humphrey composition crystallizing under the same conditions of pressure and water content?  A computational investigation using pMELTS software by [3] has shown that Humphrey liquids generally trend towards a Wishstone composition [2].  However, discrepancies between computed residual liquid compositions and the Wishstone exist for FeO, TiO2, and P2O5. Are these real, or did they arise from uncertainties in pMELTs?  If Humphrey consists of both melt and accumulated phases, could the melt lead to Wishstone-like compositions? Experiments are ongoing to answer these questions. For all experiments, a mixture of powdered oxides was used to synthesize Martian rock compositions.  This mixture was loaded into graphite capsules and dried under vacuum at 800oC in the presence of a Feo oxygen getter to prevent oxidation for "dry" experiments.  The graphite capsules were inserted into a BaCO3 sleeve, pressurized in a piston-cylinder apparatus, and heated to 1372oC before the temperature was dropped to the desired crystallization temperature.  All run products were analyzed petrographically and by electron microprobe.   Results.  Experiments on Humphrey composition at 9.3 kbar under "dry" conditions yielded olivine, pigeonite, plagioclase, and spinel as the primary crystalline phases (Table 1), with pigeonite volumetrically most abundant (Fig. 1).  Figure 2 shows the evolution of the residual liquid from the tholeiitic to the alkalic field towards the Wishstone composition.   Figure 3 indicates that although many of the major elements of the residual liquids trend towards  Table 1. Mineral assemblages and compositions of Humphrey at 9.3 kbar and "dry" conditions.

Relating Humphrey and Backstay: Crystallization of olivine tholeiite with >0.35 wt% dissolved water [4] produces liquids along the sodic silica-saturated alkalic path at 9.3 kbar.  The Columbia Hills rock Backstay shows similarities with hawaiitic liquids along this path (Fig. 4).  Could a melt of Humphrey composition give rise to Backstay liquid upon crystallization at the same conditions of pressure and water content?  Ongoing experimental efforts are addressing these questions.  For these experiments hydrous glasses were synthesized at 9.3 kbar in a pistoncylinder apparatus using large volume Pt capsules and subsequently ground for use as hydrous starting materials for experiments in graphite capsules.  The results of these experiments will be presented at the meeting. Relating Backstay and the Chassigny meteorite:  [5] noted the similarities between the cumulus and melt inclusion assemblages of the Chassigny meteorite and the mineral assemblages produced experimentally at pressures <12.3 and > 4.3 kbar from a terrestrial hawaiite with >0.5 wt% H2O along the path of Fig. 4.  Backstay is also hawaiitic in composition.  Could Backstay represent the type of hawaiite that was trapped in melt inclusions in olivine in the Chassigny meteorite? If so, it must be saturated in Fo68 olivine, and the earliest-formed melt inclusion phases (spinel and titanaugite).  Experiments are ongoing to determine if Backstay could be saturated with these phases.   Figure 4. Bulk lava compositions along a terrestrial silica-saturated sodic alkalic trend from the Nandewar volcano (gray circles, [6]) and experimental liquids derived by crystallization of hawaiite at 9.3 kbars and 2 wt% H2O (cyan squares, [7]). Plotted for comparison are Backstay (B, red square)[2], glass from Chassigny polyphase melt inclusions (C, black squares), and the evolution of olivine tholeiite at 9.3 kbars and 0.4 wt% H2O (black circles) [4].  b df 40 50 60 70 80 CaO 02 46 810 12 hAl 2O 38 10 12 14 16 18 20 SiO2 (wt%) 40 50 60 70 80 Fe OT 0 510 15 20 25 K 2 O0 12 34 56 740 50 60 70 80 MgO 02 46 810 12 ae 40 50 60 70 80 Ti O2 01 23 45 67 Na 2 O2 34 56 78 SiO2 (wt%) 40 50 60 70 80 P 2 O5 01 23 4B Cc g Relating Humphrey, Backstay, and the Chassigny meteorite assemblages: If Backstay is saturated with the same assemblage as the proposed hawaiite trapped as melt inclusions in the Chassigny meteorite, Humphrey may represent a mixture of a melt of Backstay composition, and the olivine, spinel and titanaugite of the compositions seen in the Chassigny.  Mass balance calculations show that the Humphrey bulk composition can be produced from 15 wt% Fo68 olivine, 25% En50Wo34Fs16 titanaugite, 3 wt% aluminous chromite, and 57% Backstay liquid (Î£R2=0.6).
