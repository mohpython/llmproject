Introduction: The primary science goal for this mission is to search for evidence of standing water, and to assess past environments and their suitability for supporting life [1].  While understanding past environments in Gusev and Meridiani is a priority, an additional science goal of this mission is to identify and understand current processes acting on Mars and how they have shaped the morphology of the surface in its recent history.  To help reach this goal, an extensive campaign was developed to systematically measure the thermophysical properties of the landing sites.  This involves acquiring Mini-TES emissivity spectra, supporting Pancam imagery, and MI images (when possible) to assess the variability of soils and surface properties during the rover traverses.  This work presents an analysis of Mini-TES emissivity measurements acquired at multiple times during the day of a single surface or bedform (allowing to accurately determine the thermal inertia), and information gathered from the associated Pancam and MI imagery.  This combined data set allows for 1) characterization of the surface which contributes to understanding the recent processes that have influenced these surfaces, and 2) a comparison of the recent eolian history of two regions on opposite sides of the planet.  In addition, the roving capabilities provide a unique opportunity to ground truth orbital data, because the rovers have traversed the distance of multiple THEMIS pixels.  Finally, thermal inertia information is often used to derive an effective particle size of a surface of interest, which is then used to interpret the geology of the region.  At the MER landing sites, particles may be directly measured with MI images, providing information needed to validate current techniques of calculating an effective particle size from thermal inertia data.  Validation of these methods will significantly improve our ability to interpret orbital data and understand geologic processes on Mars.   Approach:  We have developed a technique to calculate thermal inertia values using Mini-TES emissivity spectra.  Model-derived diurnal temperature curves are first calculated using the latitude, season, local time, and elevation appropriate for the landing site and observation.  The dust opacity is determined by Pancam measurements of the visible dust opacity (tau) taken the same day, and the 750 nm band in Pancam images of the same scene observed by MiniTES is used to approximate albedo.   The Mini-TES data is obtained at multiple times of day, separated by at least one hour, for a minimum of 15 minutes per observation.  Each spectrum acquired during the 15 minute time period is converted to a surface temperature by fitting a Plank function to the calibrated radiance and is averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio.  These measured temperatures are then compared to the model-derived diurnal temperature curves to determine a best approximation of the thermal inertia of the observed scene, and to identify any deviances from the model curves.  Particle sizes are determined using the technique described by Presley and Christensen [2], assuming an atmospheric pressure of 4.6 torr.  These thermally derived particle sizes are compared to particle sizes measured directly in MI images, when available, to validate the accuracy of this technique.  Due to the reduction in power, night measurements became less frequent after the primary mission (first 90 sols).  Therefore, accurate derivation of thermal inertias became more challenging later in the mission.   Gusev Crater Results:  The surface at Gusev Crater is dominated by impact and eolian activity, and disturbed soils indicate that there is cohesive strength in the upper few centimeters [1].  To study these surfaces, we systematically acquired Mini-TES temperature measurements and Pancam images to document the soil variability throughout the traverse from our landing site, named Colombia Memorial Station, towards Bonneville Crater.  Initial results indicate that thermal inertia values increase toward the crater ranging from 150 to 430 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 [3, 4].  The soil properties along this traverse remained relatively constant (Figure 1), therefore the increase in thermal inertia is likely due to an increase in rocky ejecta material near Bonneville crater.  The Mini-TES thermal inertias correspond well with values calculated from both THEMIS (270 to 345 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, avg. 306) and TES (315 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2) [4].  The lowest thermal inertia material observed was found in the hollows (150 to 240 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2), corresponding to a particle size of silt (40 µm) to medium sand (275 µm) [2, 3].  Drift deposits, which include ripples and duneforms, have inertias of 300 to 450 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 (average particle size of ~500 µm to 1 to 3 mm) [2, 3].  These derivations agree with particle size analyses from MI images resulting in a bi-modal size distribution with modes centered on fine sand (0.1 to 0.3 mm) and coarse sand to granules (1 to 3 mm) [5].   The duneforms within Bonneville crater were analyzed.  The average inertia derived from Mini-TES  is 365 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, which corresponds to an effective particle size of 1 to 2 mm [2].  Spirit did not drive into the crater, so there are no MI images of this deposit, however this thermal inertia value corresponds well with the average value of dune forming sand on Mars [6]. Meridiani Planum Results:  Opportunity landed in the eastern portion of the landing ellipse in a 20-m diameter impact crater later named Eagle Crater.  To understand the recent history of this region and to ground-truth orbital data, thermophysical measurements were focused on the Meridiani plains material and soils observed within craters.  The plains material is more homogeneous than the surfaces observed at the Gusev landing site.  The plains consist of sand-sized particles that are relatively uniform in size mixed with minor amounts of dust and uniformlydistributed spherules 0.6 to 6 mm in diameter [7] (Figure 2).  Initial results indicate a Mini-TES derived thermal inertia of ~225 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 for the plains, which corresponds to a particle size of medium sand (215 µm).  This calculation corresponds well with both THEMIS (190 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2) and TES (198 J m-2 K-1 s1/2) orbital measurements [4].  An analysis of MI images indicate a bimodal size distribution, with grains larger than 1 to 3 mm set in a matrix of very fine (<125 µm) sand [7].  These two modes are likely both detected in the Mini-TES field of view, and are both contributing to the derived thermal inertia.  In addition, the duneforms within Endurance crater were studied over a period of 5 sols.  The average thermal inertia derived from Mini-TES is 225 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, corresponding to an effective particle size of fine sand (215 µm) [2].  Due to the thickness of loose sediment near the duneforms, we were not able to maneuver the rover close enough to take MI images of the region measured by Mini-TES.  Conclusions:  Understanding the thermophysical properties of surfaces at the Spirit and Opportunity landing sites is important for identifying recent processes that have effected these regions.   The Gusev site has been dominated by impact and eolian processes.  The thermal inertia of along traverses to Bonneville Crater does increase toward the crater, but the soil properties do not vary systematically.  The higher inertias seen from orbit are likely due to the presence of rocky ejecta material rather than higher inertia soils.  The Meridiani plains are more homogeneous than the Gusev site and consist of sandsized particles mixed with minor amounts of dust.  In addition, these measurements are critical for validating our interpretations of orbital and laboratory data.  Our analysis indicates that the thermal inertias derived from Mini-TES agree to within model uncertainties with those calculated from both THEMIS and TES orbital data.  Particle sizes derived from thermal inertia generally agree with those measured in MI images, but the mixing of particle sizes and the presence of dust in the Mini-TES field of view complicates this comparison and further analysis is required to validate this technique.
