Introduction.  White Rock is an enigmatic landform discovered in Mariner 9 images [1]. The 12 x 15 km exposure of relatively bright material on the floor of 90-km crater Pollack (8oS/25oE). Albedo and the position on the crater floor led to suggestion that it is an erosional remnant of ancient lacustrine evaporite deposit [2-4]. No obvious evidences of carbonates or sulfates were found when using TES data [5] leading into the conclusion that White Rock is not an evaporite but rather an eroded accumulation of compacted or weakly cemented aeolian sedimant. Since that two important scientific finds were made: 1) Kirkland et al. [6] found that "substantial, wellcrystalline, regional mineral deposits, including rock outcrops, can be 100% exposed and remain undetected at the sensitivity of TES/THEMIS". 2) The Opportunity Mars rover found in Meridiani Planum (~1.95oS, 354.5oE, ~1,800 km WNW from White Rock) outcrops of essentially sulfate rocks interpreted to be shallow water evaporates [7,8]. Interesting that TES/THEMIS orbital observations do not detect sulfates in this locality. This makes worthwhile to reconsider if White Rock can be evaporite deposit. We do this through measuring colors of White Rock and neighboring deposits using the MEX HRSC images taken on orbit 330 and comparing these results with colors of the Opportunity sulfate and some other deposits [9]. HRSC color measurements were made using images taken through blue (440), green (530), red (750) and infrared (970nm) filters [as in 10 for Western Olympus Mons]. We used level 3 data and measured the DN values of selected target areas (orange spots in Fig. 1). Reflectance scaling factors and offsets were applied via the formula I/F = REF_OFF + REF_SCA_FAC*DN. On top of this we multiplied additional "fudge factors" provided by  Tom McCord: BL=0.9; GR=1.0; RE=1.0; IR 1.2. The results of our measurements are given in Figure 2. It is seen (Fig. 2) that in blue channel reflectivities of all studied units are very close to each other but they differ more in green, red and infrared channels. When compared with the Opportunity sulfate outcrops, White Rock shows spectral similarity with some of them (Fig. 3). The HRSC-derived spectra of deposits close to White Rock, although similar in refelectance range to the Opportunity soils, do not show negative red-toinfrared slopes typical for those soils. These deposits represent thus obviously mineralogically different material (Fig. 4). Even more obvious is the difference between the HRSC-derived spectra of the deposits close to White Rock and the spectra of natural concentrates of hematite spherules observed by the Opprtunity Pancam (Fig. 5). Discussion and conclusion: These observations suggest (but not prove) that White Rock may be an evaporite deposit resembling the Opportunity sulfate deposits. They are geographically rather close to each other and have rather similar geological position. Deposits close to White Rock differ spectrally from the Opportunity soils and hematite deposit. This, although not very conclusive, may indicate differences in mineralogy and environment between White Rock and the Opportunity site at the time of Opportunity sulfate deposition and subsequent diagenesis.
