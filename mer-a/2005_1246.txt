 MER ANALYST'S NOTEBOOK: INTEGRATING DATA AND DOCUMENTATION FOR MISSION PLAYBACK.  T. C. Stein1 and R. E.

The MER Analyst's Notebook provides access to the MER mission data archives by integrating sequence information, engineering and science data, and documentation into web-accessible pages to facilitate mission "replay." This provides context needed by scientists to understand observations made by the nondeterministic mission. The MER Notebook is not an operational but rather a reference tool made available to participating scientists and to the Planetary Data System (PDS) community. Data and documentation are transferred from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to Washington University each day throughout the mission and are ingested into the  MER science team version if the Notebook.. The public version of the Analyst's Notebook is comprised of peer-reviewed, released data and is updated coincident with quarterly PDS data releases.  Both Operations Products Generation Subsystem (OPGS) and Science data products are included in the Notebook. The OPGS products were generated to support mission planning and operations on a daily basis. They are geared toward researchers working on machine vision and engineering operations. Science products of Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Microscopic Imager (MI) observations are provided for those interested in radiometric and photometric analyses. The Analyst's Notebook provides several ways to access the mission data and documentation: . In the Notebook Navigator (Fig. 1) data products are organized in a tree structure which may be ordered by instrument, site, or sol.  . The Product View Window (Fig. 1) provides detailed information about a single product, including the PDS label. In addition, all versions of a given product may be previewed and downloaded.   Fig. 1. MER Analyst's Notebook data navigation web page. The Notebook Navigator tree structure is on the left side of screen; the Product View Window is on the right side of screen.   . . The Sol Summary reports (Fig. 2) provide per-sol listings of data products, documentation, and activity plans. . The Product Search (Fig. 3) tool allows the user to search for data by specifying parameters such as instrument, time of acquisition, feature, and target. Additional resources, including data set documents, site maps, and context images, are provided also. The first release of the Analyst's Notebook, in August 2004, was comprised of data and documentation from the first 30 sols. The Notebook for Spirit was comprised of approximately 45,000 products while that for Opportunity held about 65,000 products. During the first week of release the Notebook served requests from more than 3,500 distinct hosts and filled more than 500,000 requests. The second release in October 2004—comprised of over 1 TB of data, documentation, and support files— included results from the first 90 sols of the mission. The third release, in January 2005, covers the mission's first 180 sols and contains nearly half a million products for each rover. Updates to the Notebook coincide with quarterly PDS data releases. The MER Analyst's Notebook is available from the PDS Geosciences Node web site (http://pdsgeosciences.wustl.edu/meran).
