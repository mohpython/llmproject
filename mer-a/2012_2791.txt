 DEHYDRATION OF NA-JAROSITE, FERRICOPIAPITE, AND RHOMBOCLASE AT HIGH T AND IMPLICATIONS ON MARTIAN FERRIC SULFATES.  Yang Liu and Alian Wang, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and McDonnell Center for Space Sciences, Washington University, Campus Box 1169, Saint Louis, MO 63130, USA (liuyang@levee.wustl.edu)  Introduction:  Sulfate is one of the major types of secondary minerals found on Mars by both orbital observations (OMEGA and CRISM) and surface explorations (Mars Exploration Rovers) [e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Among the Martian sulfates, Ca- and Mg-sulfates were identified by orbital remote sensing with wide distributions and large quantities. In contrast, Fe-sulfates have been observed only in localized areas [e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9] and the overall quantity is not comparable with those of Mg-sulfates. The surface expolration of MERs have found a variety of ferric sulfates, and more importantly, the dehydration of ferric sulfates in the subsurface regolith after excavated by Spirit rover was implied on the basis of a set of consecutive Pancam observations [10]. The changes in spectral charaters of ferric sulfates after dehydration are important to uncover the mystery of relatively rarely detected ferric sulfates on Mars surface by orbital remote sensing. The stability field, including the dehydration, of ferric sulfates in T ≤ 50 °C range was investigated previously [11]. We report here an experimental study on the dehydration of ferric sulfates in a higher T range, to learn the mineral form of dehydration products and their spectral characters that might be produced by hydrothermal processes post-volcanic and post-impact event on Mars. Samples and Experiments: Na-Jarosite (NaFe 3+ 3(SO4)2(OH)6), ferricopiapite (Fe 3+ 0.66Fe 3+ 4(SO4)6(OH)2.20(H2O)), and rhomboclase (HFe 3+ (SO4)2.4(H2O))  were used as the starting phases in the experiments. The dehydrations were conducted at 50 and 95 ˚C at two relative humidity levels (5% and 10-11%) controlled by humidity buffers [12, 13]. Noninvasive Raman spectroscopy (HoloLab5000-532, KOSI) were used to make phase identifications based on the standard Raman spectra published by [14, 15] at the intermediate (5 weeks) and final stage (10 weeks) of experiments. Gravimetric measurements were made on the same samples to moniter the loss of structural H2O/OH. VIS-NIR spectra (0.4-2.5 µm) were taken using Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) on the final  dehydration product to investigate the change of spectral properties. Results and Discussion: Peaks in laser Raman spectra provide the information on the fundamental vbibration modes of the dehydration products of three ferric sulfates, thus can be directly linked to the potential crystal structural changes. Calculated H2O/OH per molecule based on gravimetric data would provide an independent evidence to support (or to question) the Raman ID. The spectral peaks of VIS-NIR are the overtones and combinational modes that have the highest application potentials for interpreting the data from planetary orbital remote sensing.  Phase ID from Raman spectroscopy: The phase identifications made by noninvasive laser Raman measurements are shown in Table 1. All of the dehydration products of Na-jarosite have lost peak details in OH vibrational region, and some of them have down shifted ν3 (SO4) (Fig 1). The changes in these spectral features imply a slight structural distortion without a large reduction of the hydration degree. At 50 ˚C and 5-11%RH, ferricopiapite dehydrated into a disorted structure,  quasi-Am as reported by [11] that can maintain  14-19 structural H2O per molecule. At 95 ˚C, the dehydration of ferricopiapite developed further: it converted totally to a dehydrated form Fe(OH)SO4 in fibroferrite4000 3600 3200 2800 4000 3600 3200 2800 Raman Shift (cm-1) jarosite jarosite_5.3%RH_95 ferricopiapite_5.3%RH_95 ferricopiapite ferricopiapite_5.5%RH_50 rhomboclase rhomboclase_5.3%RH_95 1250 1150 1050 950 1250 1150 1050 950 Raman Shift (cm-1) Figure 1 Raman spectra of three ferric sulfates and examples of their dehydration products.

The dehydration of  rhomboclase under 50 ˚C and 11% RH appeared as the intensity reduction of H2O Raman peak (4000-2800 cm -1 ), and the lost of peak details of its fundamental modes (1250-950 cm -1 ), which signify the starting of structural distortion. Under higher T (95 ˚C) or lower RH (5%), rhomboclase converted to an anhydrous crystalline phase that has a different structure from mikasaite (Fe2(SO4)3). This phase has a distinct XRD pattern that has found not match in XRD database PDF2009, and was named temporally as UK19 [11]. The flat Raman spectrum in 4000-2800 cm -1 (Fig. 1) shows that it is anhydrous.  Loss of H2O/OH during the dehydration: Losing one structural H2O/OH would cause about 3.4 wt%, 1.5 wt%, and 5.6 wt% mass variations in jarosite, ferricopiapite, and rhomboclase molecules, respectively. The banlance (Mettler PM480 DeltaRange) used for gravimetric measurements has an accuracy of ± 1 mg. The mass ranges we used in this study is ~400 mg for jarosite, ~50 mg for ferricopiapite, and ~250 mg for rhomboclase, thus the uncertainty in calculating the number of structural H2O/OH held by these molecules based on the gravimetric measurement  uncertainty was about ± 0.1 OH for jarosite, ± 1 H2O for ferricopiapite, and ± 0.1 H2O for rhomboclase. The changes in the number of structural H2O/OH per molecule for the intermediate (5 weeks) and final stage (10 weeks) are shown in Table 2. In general, the data in Table 2  fully support the mineral ID made by Raman spectroscopy,: i.e., (1) very slight  dehydration in Na-jarosite; (2) lost of 1-4 structural H2O from ferricopiapite by forming Quasi-Am and lost almost all H2O by forming Fe(OH)SO4;  (3) lost of almost all H2O from rhombioclase by forming UK19. VIS-NIR spectral characters: The examples of VISNIR spectra of Na-jarosite, ferricopiapite, and rhomboclase and their dehydration products are shown in Fig 2. Consistent with Raman ID and gravimetric data, the  OH spectral features of Na-jarosite do not significantly change, suggesting very low degree of dehydration, while there are subtle shortward wavelength shift of iron abosorption feature at ~0.9 µm and decreasing of the slope from 0.4 to 0.7 µm. Comparing to ferricopiapite, quasiAm has a very similar spectral pattern except a slight increasing of the slope from 0.43 to 0.5 µm and shortward wavelength shift of iron abosorption feature at ~0.85 µm. The dehydration product Fe(OH)SO4 has a distinct spectral partten, with almost no absorption near 1.9 µm but  a sharp absorption band at ~2.235 µm due to metal-OH vibration. The formation of Fe(OH)SO4 in our experiments through heating of ferricopiapite at midhigh temperature and low RH level is quite different from a previously reported path, i.e. heating melanterite at a much higher temperature (240 °C) [16]. The VIS-NIR spectrum of the dehydration product UK19 of rhomboclase [11] consists with Raman ID, as  an anhydrous phase of ferric sulfates, no structural H2O and OH related abosorption features observed in VIS-NIR spectral range.  Conclusions: Our dehydration experiments show that OH-bearing Na-jarosite is relatively stable at 95 °C and RH ≤ 11%,  while H2O/OH-bearing ferricopiapite and rhomboclase have converted entirely to anhydrous phases. It means if on Mars these two Fesulfates were found (Tyrone site at Gusev), the location should not have experienced a T > 95 °C.
