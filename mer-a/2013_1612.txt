Opaline silica at the Home Plate is believed to be associated with hydrothermal processes, however the specific origin (fumaroles, hot springs or geysers) remains unresolved [3]. Conversely, orbital spectral evidence for opal in deposits near Vallis Marineris may be associated with low temperature acidic aqueous alteration [1]. Opaline silica is formed under a wide range of conditions on Earth, and while it is indicative of aqueous processes, the specific environmental conditions of silica formation are difficult to interpret based solely on its identification. Factors such as rind thickness, water-to-rock ratio, associated minerals, and texture/morphology may contain information about environmental formation conditions, and such factors may manifest themselves in visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) spectra. Therefore, detailed analysis of silica-rich materials from various terrestrial environments (fumarolic, hot spring, acid sulfate, acid fog) may help to constrain their formation conditions on Mars [4].  Previous studies have shown that spectral signatures of basalt can be strongly affected by even thin coatings of silica [5,6], and the question remains as to whether or not such rocks are spectrally distinct from opal formed in hot spring, fumarolic or other environments. Here we characterize the weathering products from three basaltic lava flows of different ages from Mauna Loa, HI, representing various stages of leaching and deposition. The properties of the silica coatings that affect spectral behavior (thickness and morphology) and secondary mineralogy of these samples, are compared to VIS-NIR spectra of samples collected from hot springs in Yellowstone NP, Wyoming, and near fumaroles in Volcanoes NP, Hawaii. Our goal is to assess which attributes, if any, are clearly linked to different formation environments and whether or not such attributes are linked to VIS-NIR spectral properties that can be observed from orbit or in situ on Mars.   Methods and Materials: Opaline sinter deposits were measured in situ with an ASD FieldSpec3 (0.32.5 µm) in Yellowstone NP and selected samples were acquired for additional laboratory measurements. Similar measurements were carried out for fumarolic deposits in Volcanoes National Park, HI, including sites at Steam Vents and Sulphur Banks. Basaltic lava flows from Mona Loa were also analyzed in-situ, and three lava flow samples (HIML06, HIML10, and HIML03) were collected specifically because they display increasing degrees of alteration with age. Lab reflectance spectra were measured on fractured chips using a combination of the ASD FieldSpec3 and an FTIR spectrometer equipped with a biconical diffuse reflectance attachment.  Temperature and relative humidity can be controlled in-situ for either spectrometer by using a low temperature reaction chamber and salt solutions. The silica coatings were analyzed on both the fractured chips and polished samples using a LEO 1520 variable pressure SEM. Mineralogy and coating morphology was determined through a combination of SE/BSE imaging and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS).  Polished samples were mounted in an epoxy resin and polished down to 0.05 μm using an alumina suspension.  The chips were rough ground to expose both fresh and weathered surfaces.  Monte Carlo modeling [7] was used to aid in estimating coating thickness, as well as modal mineralogy. Results:  The hand samples from the weathered lava flows and corresponding SEM images of the silica coatings are presented in Figure 1.  HIML06 displays uniform color, texture, and minimal alteration of the basaltic glass parent material.  There is a very thin silica veneer (~0.5μm) on the surface that does not penetrate into the sample.  HIML10 displays a reddish discoloration from alteration and the glassy basaltic surface displays some mottling, suggestive of more extensive alteration. The surface coatings are thicker (~5 μm) and more pervasive (as vesicle fills).  HIML03 displays extensive surface alteration that permeates into vesicle interiors.  Thick, opaline silica coatings are    Figure 1:  Field samples collected from Mona Loa, HI (top row) showing increasing alteration features with age.  The corresponding SEM images (bottom row) show increasing silica coating thicknesses with age.    mailto:kevin_robertson@brown.edu observed in HIML03 (>50μm), with extensive secondary alteration assemblages localized within vesicles. This suite of samples is not directly adjacent to a fumorolic vent, therefore any alteration is likely the result of meteoric water, or alteration by acid fog or rain. The smooth boundary between the coatings and the unaltered basalt in HIML06 and HIML10 suggests that the mechanism of silica enrichment may be by precipitation as opposed to leaching. Silica coatings found in the interior vesicles (HIML10) implies that with increasing age, the silica rich fluids penetrate further into the sample.   HIML06 and HIML10 do not display any secondary mineralogy beyond the silica coatings. HIML03 displays a complex secondary alteration profile consisting of CaSO4 phases, Fe-Ti oxides, Aloxides and Al-silicates, consistent with acid-sulfate alteration.  However, the spectra (Figure 3) do not show clear evidence of secondary alteration phases, likely due to their apparent concentration in vesicle interiors. Differentiation between such samples based on alteration mineralogy may be limited to in-situ analysis, as opposed to orbital spectroscopy.  A comparison of typical hydrated silica spectra for different conditions of formation (Fig. 3) highlights the difficulty in distinguishing between different environments based solely on spectral absorption features at VIS-NIR wavelengths.  Si-OH absorption features (~2.15 - 2.35 µm) alone do not appear to be diagnostic of the environment of formation. Therefore additional petrologic attributes, or spectral properties are needed to distinguish between types of opal.   Qualitatively, there are differences in the band depth, width, position, and ratios for the ~1.4, 1.9 and   2.21-2.26 μm regions, similar to recent results by Rice et al. [2012].  However, preliminary analysis of these spectral parameters has not resulted in obvious correlations between formation environments and reflectance properties. Additional contextual information (e.g., trace chemistry, microscale texture, porosity, etc.) may prove to be more informative for distinguishing between different opal formation environments.  Exceptions include weakly altered silica-coated basalts. Reflectance spectra of these samples exhibit broad absorption features near ~1 and 2 µm, due to the presence of Fe in the underlying basaltic (glassy) material. However, more heavily weathered samples, with thicker silica coatings (e.g., HIML03, Figures 23), lack these features, making them difficult to distinguish from opaline silica formed in other environments. Conclusions:  At VIS-NIR wavelengths, Si-OH absorption features at 2.21-2.26 µm alone may be insufficient to interpret formation environments for opaline silica deposits detected on Mars. Altered basalts, with thin silica coatings, may still exhibit features associated with Fe in glass, but spectra of samples with thicker coatings can be strikingly similar to opaline silica formed in hot spring environments. Trace element chemistry, microscale textures, and geologic context are needed to complement spectral data and to constrain formation environments for Martian silica deposits.
