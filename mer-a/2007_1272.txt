 HYPOTHESIS FOR PETROGENESIS OF WISHSTONE-CLASS ROCKS IN GUSEV CRATER: IMPLICATIONS FOR CO2 INVENTORY IN THE MARTIAN MANTLE.  T. Usui1 and H. Y. McSween Jr.1, 1Dept. of Earth Planet. Sci., University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 (tusui@utk.edu) Introduction: Mars is more volatile rich than Earth, reflecting a higher component of accreted volatile-bearing planetesimals [1]. Volatiles, although normally present in only small amounts, can profoundly affect the thermodynamic properties of magma, and thus play an important role in generating a variety of igneous rock types. In Gusev crater, the Spirit rover has encountered volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks representing a remarkable diversity of alkaline compositions [2, 3]. Here we focus on Wishstone-class tephrites (Wishstone and Champagne are the only analyzed samples), because they have suffered a relatively low degree of alteration [4] and are unusually enriched in incompatible elements (P, Ti) with low SiO2 contents (~45 wt%); these compositions cannot be explained by any fractionation processes from primitive basaltic magma of Gusev plains (similar to Adirondack-class rocks) even at high pressure and high pH2O conditions [2]. We explore the possibility that these rocks formed in association with carbonatitic magma.  Therefore, investigating the petrogenesis of the Wishstone-class could yield insights into CO2 inventory in the Martian mantle. Results and discussions: The APXS measured the chemical compositions of: un-brushed, RAT-brushed and RAT-abraded Wishstone and Champagne. The analyses show high SO3 in un-brushed, to moderate SO3 in brushed and low SO3 in RATed. Unbrushed surfaces are interpreted to represent mixtures of adhering soil/dust and thin alteration zone, and brushed and RATed surfaces represent mixtures of alteration zones and rock interiors with different mixing ratios [2, 4]. By extrapolating a trend defined by the brushed and RATed compositions for each rock to lower SO3 contents, the compositional ranges of Wishstone-class rock interiors are estimated (Fig. 1).  Values for the range are bracketed by subtending the extrapolated line at SO3 contents equal to their RATed values or of 0.75 wt% (the average sulfur abundance in Martian basaltic meteorites) [5]. The pristine rock compositions should reside within the calculated compositional range. Differences between maximum and minimum values for Al2O3, MnO, FeO and Na2O are relatively small, but those for SiO2, CaO and P2O5 are significant; CaO and P2O5 increase but SiO2 decreases with decreasing SO3 contents (Table 1; Fig. 1). Striking features of the Wishstone class, high-P2O5 with lowSiO2, are enhanced by the extrapolations. This suggests that these features are not attributable to secondary alteration but could represent pristine igneous rock compositions.

Two unusual terrestrial rock suites may provide insights into the protolith of Wishstone-class rocks. One is Fe-Ti-P-rich rock (FTP) from the jotunite suite [7]. Although several hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of these rocks, they are not mutually exclusive and suggest that the jotunite suite is closely related to the formation of Proterozoic massif anorthosites and possibly originates in a residual liquid. However, FTP rocks contain abundant FeO (>20 wt%), which is distinct from the Wishstone-class. Furthermore, anorthosite has not been found in Gusev Crater or elsewhere on Mars, despite systematic searches for plagioclase using MGS-TES data [K. A. Milam, in prep.]. Fig. 2: Estimated whole-rock compositions of Wishstoneclass rocks. Compositional fields of pyroxenites, ijolitemelteigite suites and nepheline-apatite ores are from carbonatite-bearing alkaline complexes in the Kola Peninsula. Arrows indicate mixing trajectories from Wishstone-class rocks to apatite (Apt) and whitlockite (Whl). Abbreviations are as in Fig. 1. High-P2O5 rocks also occur in association with carbonatite-bearing alkaline complexes. As carbonatitic melt dissolves abundant P2O5 (>10 wt%, depending on temperature) [8], some complexes are known as magmatic phosphate deposits [9]. They mainly consist of alkaline rocks, ultramafic cumulates, and carbonatites. The composition of the Wishstoneclass could be explained by the mixing of apatite/whitlockite into the alkaline rocks but not the ultramafic ones; this mixing trajectory is well expressed by the trend of nepheline-apatite ores (Fig. 2). This mixing relationship is also demonstrated for the other elements listed in Table 1. Thus, we propose that the Wishstone-class may originate in an alkaline suite related to a carbonatite-bearing alkaline complex. This hypothesis is consistent with the inferred pyroclastic texture of Wishstone-class rocks (many carbonatitic complexes contain tuffs) [10] and the existence of other alkaline rocks in Gusev Crater. However, carbonates have not been detected in these rocks from Mini-TES spectra. This can be explained by the fact that the amounts of carbonates in terrestrial alkaline rocks from carbonatite-bearing alkaline complex are small and these carbonates are readily dissolved by alteration.  The CO2 inventory of Mars has remained controversial. Although Mars inherited a high proportion of volatiles during accretion, the apparent inventory of carbon on Mars is only 10-3 that of Earth or Venus [11]. Melting experiments of CO2-bearing lherzolite (CMAS.CO2) suggest that CO2 dissolves in silicate melt at pressures greater than 2.6 GPa and produces a carbonatitic melt [12]. Thus, our hypothesis suggests that, at least under Gusev crater, CO2 resided in the Mars mantle.     References: [1] Wänke H. and Dreibus G. (1988) Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. London A325, 545-557.
