Introduction:  The Panoramic Camera (Pancam) on the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity acquired visible/near-infrared (432-1009 nm) images [1] of three cobble-sized Fe-Ni meteorites informally named "Block Island", "Shelter Island", and "Mackinac Island" between Sols 1961 (July 30, 2009) and 2038 (Oct. 17, 2009) (Figure 1).  Similar to the Fe-Ni meteorite Heat Shield Rock (Meridiani Planum) imaged on Sol 352 (Jan. 19, 2005) [2], the surfaces of these three meteorites demonstrate variable degrees of dust contamination along with discontinuous coatings that exhibit Pancam reflectance spectra consistent with ferric oxides, suggestive of chemical weathering on portions of the meteorite surfaces.    Observations.  Block Island was imaged between Sols 1961-2003 during in situ observations and at six locations during circumnavigation of the rock.  Shelter Island images were acquired during Sols 2022-2034 from five different locations, and images of Mackinac Island (Sols 2035-2038) were acquired at three locations, although only one image set included all Pancam geology filters.    Results.  Pancam spectra of the meteorites suggest that a coating of variable thickness, ferric-rich nanophase dust contaminated the rock surfaces.  Nonetheless, distinct color variations were observed on each meteorite, including intermittent patches of smooth materials with "purple" hues in Pancam false-color representations using 432 nm, 535 nm, 753 nm filters (and in decorrelation stretches using the same filters; Fig. 1). These materials exhibit lobate margins in Microscopic Imager (MI) images that appear to coat the underlying meteorite surface (Figure 2).  These surfaces consistently exhibit greater 535 nm band depths and more negative nearinfrared slopes (753 nm to 934 nm) than the typical meteorite surface over the ~40-80° phase angle range observed.  Larger amounts of dust contamination likely cause greater 535 nm band depths, particularly for Block Island (Table 1).  However, typical meteorite surfaces exhibit 535 nm band depths near zero (or negative), consistent with Fe-Ni meteorite spectra. Figure 3 shows Pancam spectra of representative surfaces taken from each meteorite compared to a laboratory spectrum of the Fe-Ni meteorite Canyon Diablo, which exhibits a featureless, positive slope.  The "purple" patches are darker at all wavelengths than the typical meteorite surfaces for all rocks except Heat Shield Rock (HSR), for which the reverse is true for the unbrushed portions, and for the brushed spot at wavelengths > 600 nm.  This may be a consequence of the dearth of dust contamination compared to the other meteorites, based on the low 535 nm band depths (Table 1) and lack of a downturn from 934 nm to 1009 nm that is observed for all other rock surfaces (Fig. 3) and pockets of airfall dust.    Table 1.  Average 535 nm band depths Meteorite "Purple" patch Typical surface Heat Shield Rock 0.03 -0.18 Block Island 0.19 0.12 Shelter Island 0.11 -0.01 Mackinac Island 0.09 0.00  Analysis and Conclusions.  The spectral features observed by Opportunity for the "purple" coatings on Fe-Ni meteorites are consistent with a more oxidized surface than typical meteorite surfaces.  This is likely a mixture of ferric materials, dominated by nanophase (np-) hematite (particles diameters <10 nm), as evidenced by strong 535 nm absorptions combined with lack of the 860 nm band (usually observed in crystalline hematite [3]). This is consistent with Mössbauer data that suggest minor phases of ferric oxide such as np-hematite in addition to kamacite [5].  Preliminary APXS data suggest that the purple coatings are enriched in Mg, Br, and Zn relative to the rest of the meteorite surface.  These observations suggest that the "purple" coatings are an altered or secondary weathering coating, perhaps partially eroded by aeolian abrasion, rather than a remnant fusion crust on the meteorite.
