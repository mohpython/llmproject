Introduction:  The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit explored the Columbia Hills of Gusev Crater from mid-2004 until mid-2010 (see Fig. 1).   The formation of the Hills is uncertain; they are hypothesized to be overlapping crater rims, or the remains of a central peak formation [1, 2].  It is not known whether the units visible along the rover's traverse are part of the original Columbia Hills edifice, or were deposited after the Hills were uplifted.  In the former case, outcrop bedding attitudes should conform to local topography, while with the latter, their dips may be significantly steeper. The purpose of this study is to test the hypotheses that the outcrops that Spirit encountered are 1) in-place bedrock which 2) drape an underlying Columbia Hills structure.   Figure 1.  Spirit's traverse through the Columbia Hills.  The yellow rectangle indicates the region shown in Figs. 3 and 4.  HiRISE image draped over HiRISE Digital Elevation Model.  Dataset and Method:  Spirit encountered several large (~0.5-10m) outcrops on the West Spur and Husband Hill, which are interpreted to be local bedrock.  We measure the orientations (strikes and dips) of these outcrops by examining hundreds of fine-scale (~1100cm) features using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived from the rover's Pancam and Navcam stereo imaging data [3].  Our dataset consists of every Pancam stereo pair, including subframe images, from Sol 180 to Sol 705.  We use Navcam stereo observations where Pancam stereo coverage was not acquired.   We thoroughly examine all of the stereo image data for each outcrop and trace the finest-scale layering (often <1cm).  The trace must exhibit significant relief in order for the orientation to be determined.  We measure up to several dozen features on each outcrop (see Fig. 2).  We estimate layer strike, dip, associated uncertainty, and coplanarity, using the method of Watters et al. (2011) [4].  We use a bootstrap analysis [5] to rigorously estimate the uncertainty in our measurements.  The error analysis includes 1000 bootstrap samplings, which were sampled with replacement.      Figure 2.  Measurement locations (left) and their respective strikes and dips (right) for the Indpendence outcrop target Betsy.  The image on the left is ~18cm across.  Error bars represent 2σ uncertainties in the individual measurements, as estimated by the bootstrap analysis.  The uncertainties reported for each outcrop in Table 1 are the variences of the individual uncertainties.    Results:  Bedding plane orientation measurements for 13 outcrop units are shown in Table 1 and mapped in Figs. 3 and 4.  The uncertainty reported for each outcrop is the variance of the uncertainties on the individual measurements for that outcrop. We note that for those outcrops which were measured both with this technique and with that of McCoy et al. (2008) [1], our dips are significantly steeper. Our measurements are consistent with the hypotheses that the measured exposures are in-place bedrock which drape an underlying structure, though we note that some measurements are steeper than typical angles of repose.  Additionally, the data are consistent with the following stratigraphic relationships: 1) the Peace Class outcrops (Peace and Alligator) are stratigraphically higher than the Cumberland Ridge outcrops (Methuselah and Larry's Lookout), and 2) Kansas is stratigraphically higher than the Summit outcrops.  These relationships are consistent with Crumpler et al. (2011).  The measured dips are significantly steeper than the local topography (see Fig. 4), indicating that a considerable amount of material has been removed from Husband Hill.  Table 1.  Measured strikes and dips for the West Spur and Husband Hill outcrops along Spirit's traverse.  Strikes are reported in degrees with respect to North; an easterly trending strike would be 90°.  These results are mapped in Figs. 3 and 4.

West Spur and Husband Hill strikes and dips on the boxed region of Figure 1.  The red dotted line indicates Spirit's traverse.  Bedding orientations are roughly symmetrical across Tennessee Valley.  The Cumberland Ridge (Methuselah and Larry's Lookout) and Summit bedding orientations are roughly symmetrical across Tennessee Valley (see Fig. 3).  These exposures have similar compositions [6-11]; if they are indeed a single stratigraphic unit, our measurements indicate that the original Husband Hill summit may have been located above what is now Tennessee Valley.   Figure 4.  Bedding plane strikes and dips on a map indicating slopes on the West Spur and Husband Hill.  The red dotted line indicates Spirit's traverse.  Slopes along the traverse range from 0 to 30°, and are derived from a HiRISE Digital Elevation Model.  The measured dips are significantly steeper than the topographic slopes.
